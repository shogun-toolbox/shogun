  \section intro_sec Introduction
  SHOGUN is a large scale machine learning toolbox with focus on especially
  Support Vector Machines (SVM). It provides a generic SVM object interfacing
  to several different SVM implementations, among them the state of the art
  LibSVM, SVMLight, SVMLin and GPDT. Each of the SVMs can be combined with a
  variety of kernels. The toolbox not only provides efficient implementations
  of the most common kernels, like the Linear, Polynomial, Gaussian and Sigmoid
  %Kernel but also comes with a number of recent string kernels as e.g. the
  Locality Improved, Fischer, TOP, Spectrum, Weighted Degree %Kernel (with
  shifts). For the latter the efficient LINADD optimizations are
  implemented. Also SHOGUN offers the freedom of working with custom
  pre-computed kernels. One of its key features is the combined kernel which
  can be constructed by a weighted linear combination of a number of
  sub-kernels, each of which not necessarily working on the same domain. An
  optimal sub-kernel weighting can be learned using Multiple %Kernel Learning.
  Currently SVM 2-class classification and regression problems can be dealt
  with. However SHOGUN also implements a number of linear methods like Linear
  Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear Programming Machine (LPM), (%Kernel)
  Perceptrons and features algorithms to train hidden markov models. The input
  feature-objects can be dense, sparse or strings and of type
  int/short/double/char and can be converted into different feature types.
  Chains of preprocessors (e.g.  subtracting the mean) can be attached to each
  feature object allowing for on-the-fly pre-processing.

  SHOGUN is implemented in C++ and interfaces to Matlab(tm), R, Octave and
  Python \ref interfaces "(see Interfaces)".
