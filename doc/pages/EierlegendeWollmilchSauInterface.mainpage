/*! \page elwmsinterface Eierlegendewollmilchsau Interface

As mentioned before SHOGUN interfaces to several programming languages and
toolkits such as Matlab(tm), R, Python, Octave. The special
Eierlegendewollmilchsau (elwms) interface does everything in one file. It is a
chimera of all the \subpage staticinterfaces, thus all the examples and
documentation form \subpage staticinterfaces still apply.

One of the key strengths of this interface is that it provides the
\verbatim
elwms('run_python', 'A', A, ..., pythoncode, '...')
elwms('run_r', 'A', A, ..., 'rfile', '...')
elwms('run_octave', 'A', A, ..., octavecode, '...')
\endverbatim

interoperability commands that enable running of code in foreign languages. For
example

\verbinclude octave_matplotlib.m

allows us to use matplotlib to plot figures from within octave! All the types
that shogun supports when translating variables between languages. In this case
two floating point matrices A and B are passed to python and they are passed
back from python unchanged together with a list of strings and another variable
x. Note that the it uses \b elwms instead of \b sg as function name.

In addition it is suggested to have a look at the examples/elwms directory for
additional commands elwms provides.
