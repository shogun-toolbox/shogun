Tanimoto distance
=================

The Tanimoto distance/coefficient (extended Jaccard coefficient)
is obtained by extending the cosine similarity.

:math:`d(\bf{x},\bf{x'}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x'_{i}} {\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}x'_{i}x'_{i}-x_{i}x'_{i}} \ 
\quad x,x' \in R^{n}`
 
-------
Example
-------

We start by creating CDenseFeatures (here 64 bit floats aka RealFeatures) from files with training and test data.
.. sgexample:: tanimoto_distance.sg:create_features

Then, we create an instance of TanimotoDistance, passing it the training data.
.. sgexample:: tanimoto_distance.sg:create_distance

Subsequently, we retrieve the distance for the training data. After that we initialize both training and test data and retrieve the distance of the test data.
