    "A (single layer) [autoencoder](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/dA.html#autoencoders) is a neural network that has three layers: an input layer, a hidden (encoding) layer, and a decoding layer. The network is trained to reconstruct its inputs, which forces the hidden layer to try to learn good representations of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to encourage the hidden layer to learn good input representations, certain variations on the simple autoencoder exist. Shogun currently supports two of them: Denoising Autoencoders [1] and Contractive Autoencoders [2]. In this notebook we'll focus on denoising autoencoders. \n",
    "\n",
    "For denoising autoencoders, each time a new training example is introduced to the network, it's randomly corrupted in some mannar, and the target is set to the original example. The autoencoder will try to recover the orignal data from it's noisy version, which is why it's called a denoising autoencoder. This process will force the hidden layer to learn a good representation of the input, one which is not affected by the corruption process.\n",

    "A deep autoencoder is an autoencoder with multiple hidden layers. Training such autoencoders directly is usually difficult, however, they can be pre-trained as a stack of single layer autoencoders. That is, we train the first hidden layer to reconstruct the input data, and then train the second hidden layer to reconstruct the states of the first hidden layer, and so on. After pre-training, we can train the entire deep autoencoder to fine-tune all the parameters together. We can also use the autoencoder to initialize a regular neural network and train it in a supervised manner.\n",

This restriction is necessary for pre-training to work. More details on that can found in the following section.\n",
