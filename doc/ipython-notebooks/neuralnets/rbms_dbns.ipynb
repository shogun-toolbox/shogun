      "An [RBM](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rbm.html) is an **energy based probabilistic model**. It consists of two groups of variables: the **visible variables** $ v $ and the **hidden variables** $ h $. The key assumption that RBMs make is that the hidden units are conditionally independent given the visible units, and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RBM defines its distribution through an **energy function** $E(v,h)$, which is a function that assigns a number (called energy) to each possible state of the visible and hidden variables. The probability distribution is defined as:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ P(v,h) := \\frac{\\exp(-E(v,h))}{Z} , \\qquad Z = \\sum_{v,h} \\exp(-E(v,h))$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $Z$ is a constant that makes sure that the distribution sums/integrates to $1$. This distribution is also called a Gibbs distribution and $Z$ is sometimes called the **partition function**.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the definition of $P(v,h)$ we can see that the probability of a configuration increases as its energy decreases. Training an RBM in an unsupervised manner involves manipulating the energy function so that it would assign low energy (and therefore high probability) to values of $v$ that are similar to the training data, and high energy to values that are far from the training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an RBM with binary visible and hidden variables the energy function is defined as:\n",
      "\n",
      "$ E(v,h) = -\\sum_i \\sum_j h_i W_{ij} v_j - \\sum_i h_i c_i - \\sum_j v_j b_j $\n",
      "\n",
      "where $b \\in \\mathbb{R^n} $ is the bias for the visible units, $c \\in \\mathbb{R^m}$ is the bias for hidden units and $ W \\in \\mathbb{R^{mxn}}$ is the weight matrix between the hidden units and the visible units.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plugging that definition into the definition of the probability distribution will yield the following conditional distributions for each of the hidden and visible variables:\n",
      "\n",
