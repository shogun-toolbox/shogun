There is also another nuance that I would like to mention here: pylab is actually doing quite a lot for us here that you might not be aware of. It does a pretty good job determining the value range of the image to be shown and then it applies the color map. Many other libraries (for example OpenCV's highgui) won't be this helpful and you'll need to remember to scale the image appropriately on your own before trying to display it. "
