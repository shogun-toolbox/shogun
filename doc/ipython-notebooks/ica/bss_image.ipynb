There is also another nuance that I would like to mention here: pylab is actually doing quite a lot for us here that you might not be aware of. It does a pretty good job determining the value range of the image to be shown and then it applies the color map. Many other libraries (for example OpenCV's highgui) won't be this helpful and you'll need to remember to scale the image appropriately on your own before trying to display it. "

Again we need to reshape the images before viewing them and an additional nuance was to add the *-1 to the first separated signal. I did this after viewing the result the first time as the image was clearly inversed, this can happen because ICA can't necessarily capture the correct phase."
