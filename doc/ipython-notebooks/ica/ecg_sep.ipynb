There are several different approaches for handling this situation, some algorithms are specifically designed to handle this case while other times the data is pre-processed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is also common to simply apply the separation to all the sources and then choose some of the extracted signal manually or using some other know criteria which is what I'll be showing in this example."
