    "My favorite example of this problem is known as the *cocktail party problem* where a number of people are talking simultaneously and we want to separate each persons speech so we can listen to it separately. Now the caveat with this type of approach is that we need as many mixtures as we have source signals or in terms of the cocktail party problem we need as many microphones as people talking in the room."

    "Let's get started, this example is going to be in python and the first thing we are going to need to do is load some audio files. To make things a bit easier further on in this example I'm going to wrap the basic scipy wav file reader and add some additional functionality. First I added a case to handle converting stereo wav files back into mono wav files and secondly this loader takes a desired sample rate and resamples the input to match. This is important because when we mix the two audio signals they need to have the same sample rate. "

    "Shogun also has several other ICA algorithms including the Second Order Blind Identification (SOBI) algorithm, FFSep, JediSep, UWedgeSep and FastICA. All of the algorithms inherit from the ICAConverter base class and share some common methods for setting an intial guess for the mixing matrix, retrieving the final mixing matrix and getting/setting the number of iterations to run and the desired convergence tolerance. Some of the algorithms have additional getters for intermediate calculations, for example Jade has a method for returning the 4th order cumulant tensor while the \"Sep\" algorithms have a getter for the time lagged covariance matrices.
