    "To set the context, we here briefly describe statistical hypothesis testing. Informally, one defines a hypothesis on a certain domain and then uses a statistical test to check whether this hypothesis is true. Formally, the goal is to reject a so-called *null-hypothesis* $H_0:p=q$, which is the complement of an *alternative-hypothesis* $H_A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To distinguish the hypotheses, a test statistic is computed on sample data. Since sample data is finite, this corresponds to sampling the true distribution of the test statistic. There are two different distributions of the test statistic -- one for each hypothesis. The *null-distribution* corresponds to test statistic samples under the model that $H_0$ holds; the *alternative-distribution* corresponds to test statistic samples under the model that $H_A$ holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, one tries to compute the quantile of the test statistic in the null-distribution. In case the test statistic is in a high quantile, i.e. it is unlikely that the null-distribution has generated the test statistic -- the null-hypothesis $H_0$ is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different kinds of errors in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    " *  A *type I error* is made when $H_0: p=q$ is wrongly rejected. That is, the test says that the samples are from different distributions when they are not.\n",
    " *  A *type II error* is made when $H_A: p\\neq q$ is wrongly accepted. That is, the test says that the samples are from the same distribution when they are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A so-called *consistent* test achieves zero type II error for a fixed type I error, as it sees more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide whether to reject $H_0$, one could set a threshold, say at the $95\\%$ quantile of the null-distribution, and reject $H_0$ when the test statistic lies below that threshold. This means that the chance that the samples were generated under $H_0$ are $5\\%$. We call this number the *test power* $\\alpha$ (in this case $\\alpha=0.05$). It is an upper bound on the probability for a type I error. An alternative way is simply to compute the quantile of the test statistic in the null-distribution, the so-called *p-value*, and to compare the p-value against a desired test power, say $\\alpha=0.05$, by hand. The advantage of the second method is that one not only gets a binary answer, but also an upper bound on the type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to construct a two-sample test, the null-distribution of the test statistic has to be approximated. One way of doing this is called the *permutation test*, where samples from both sources are mixed and permuted repeatedly and the test statistic is computed for every of those configurations. While this method works for every statistical hypothesis test, it might be very costly because the test statistic has to be re-computed many times. Shogun comes with an extremely optimized implementation though. For completeness, Shogun also includes a number of more sohpisticated ways of approximating the null distribution."
