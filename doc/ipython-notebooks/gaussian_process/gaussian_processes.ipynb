Note that this is averaged over *all* possible configurations of the latent Gaussian variables $\\mathbf{f}|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$  given a fixed configuration of parameters. However, since this is probability distribution, it has to integrate to $1$. This means that models that are too complex (and thus being able to explain too many different data configutations) and models that are too simple (and thus not able to explain the current data) give rise to a small marginal likelihood. Only when the model is just complex enough to explain the data well (but not more complex), the marginal likelihood is maximised. This is an implementation of a concept called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor#Probability_theory_and_statistics\">Occam's razor</a>, and is a nice motivation why you should be Bayesian if you can -- overfitting doesn't happen that quickly.\n",

    "As mentioned before, Shogun is able to automagically learn all of the hyper-parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ using gradient based optimisation on the marginal likelihood (whose derivatives are computed internally). To this is, we use the class <a href=\"http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CGradientModelSelection.html\">CGradientModelSelection</a>. Note that we could also use <a href=\"http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CGridSearchModelSelection.html\">CGridSearchModelSelection</a> to do a standard grid-search, such as is done for Support Vector Machines. However, this is highly ineffective, in particular when the number of parameters grows. In addition, order to evaluate parameter states, we have to use the classes <a href=\"http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CGradientEvaluation.html\">CGradientEvaluation</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1GradientCriterion.html\">GradientCriterion</a>, which is also much cheaper than the usual  <a href=\"http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CCrossValidation.html\">CCrossValidation</a>, since it just evaluates the gradient of the marginal likelihood rather than performing many training and testing runs. This is another very nice motivation for using Gaussian Processes: optimising parameters is much easier. In the following, we demonstrate how to select *all* parameters of the used model.  In Shogun, parameter configurations (corresponding to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ are stored in instances of  <a href=\"http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CParameterCombination.html\">CParameterCombination</a>, which can be applied to machines.\n",

This is caused by the different kernel scalling that was also learned automatically. The kernel scaling, roughly speaking, corresponds to the sharpness of the changes in the surface of the predictive likelihood. Since we have two hyper-parameters, we can plot the surface of the marginal likelihood as a function of both of them. This is sometimes interesting, for example when this surface has multiple maximum (corresponding to multiple \"best\" parameter settings), and thus might be useful for analysis.

This reduces the computational complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$, where again $n$ is the number of training points, and $m$ is the number of inducing points.
