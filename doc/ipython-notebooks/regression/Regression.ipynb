      "The first plot is the famous ridge trace that is the signature of this technique. The plot is really very straight forward to read. It presents the standardized regression coefficients (weights) on the vertical axis and various values of tau (Regularisation constant) along the horizontal axis. Since the values of tau ($\\tau$) span several orders of magnitude, we adopt a logarithmic scale along this axis. As tau is increased, the values of the regression estimates change, often wildly at first. At some point, the coefficients seem to settle down and then gradually drift towards zero. Often the value of tau for which these coefficients are at their stable values is the best one. This should be supported by a low error value for that tau.\n"
