    "It is usually better to preprocess data to a standard form rather than handling it in raw form. The reasons are having a well behaved-scaling, many algorithms assume centered data, and that sometimes one wants to de-noise data (with say PCA). Preprocessors do not change the domain of the input features. It is possible to do various type of preprocessing using methods provided by [CPreprocessor](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CPreprocessor.html) class. Some of these are:<ul><li>[Norm one](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CNormOne.html): Normalize vector to have norm 1.</li><li>[PruneVarSubMean](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CPruneVarSubMean.html):  Substract the mean and remove features that have zero variance. </li><li>[Dimension Reduction](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CDimensionReductionPreprocessor.html): Lower the dimensionality of given simple features.<ul><li>[PCA](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CPCA.html): Principal component analysis.</li><li>[Kernel PCA](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CKernelPCA.html): PCA using kernel methods.</li></ul></li></ul> The training data will now be preprocessed using [CPruneVarSubMean](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CPruneVarSubMean.html). This will basically remove data with zero variance and subtract the mean. Passing a `True` to the constructor makes the class normalise the varaince of the variables. It basically dividies every dimension through its standard-deviation. This is the reason behind removing dimensions with constant values.  It is required to initialize the preprocessor by passing the feature object to `init` before doing anything else. The raw and processed data is now plotted."
