    "A possible workaround to improve the performance of kNN in a data set like this would be to input to the kNN routine a distance measure. For instance, in the example above a good distance measure would give more weight to the y-direction than to the x-direction to account for the large spread along the x-axis. Nonetheless, it would be nicer (and, in fact, much more useful in practice) if this distance could be learnt automatically from the data at hand. Actually, LMNN is based upon this principle: given a number of neighbours *k*, find the Mahalanobis distance measure which maximizes kNN accuracy (using the given value for *k*) in a training data set. As we usually do in machine learning, under the assumption that the training data is an accurate enough representation of the underlying process, the distance learnt will not only perform well in the training data, but also have good generalization properties.

    "LMNN is one of the so-called linear metric learning methods. What this means is that we can understand LMNN's output in two different ways: on the one hand, as a distance measure, this was explained above; on the other hand, as a linear transformation of the input data. Like any other linear transformation, LMNN's output can be written as a matrix, that we will call $L$. In other words, if the input data is represented by the matrix $X$, then LMNN can be understood as the data transformation expressed by $X'=L X$. We use the convention that each column is a feature vector; thus, the number of rows of $X$ is equal to the input dimension of the data, and the number of columns is equal to the number of vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, so good. But, if the output of the same method can be interpreted in two different ways, then there must be a relation between them! And that is precisely the case! As mentioned above, the ellipses that were plotted in the previous section represent a distance measure. This distance measure can be thought of as a matrix $M$, being the distance between two vectors $\\vec{x_i}$ and $\\vec{x_j}$ equal to $d(\\vec{x_i},\\vec{x_j})=(\\vec{x_i}-\\vec{x_j})^T M (\\vec{x_i}-\\vec{x_j})$. In general, this type of matrices are known as *Mahalanobis* matrices. In LMNN, the matrix $M$ is precisely the 'square' of the linear transformation $L$, i.e. $M=L^T L$. Note that a direct consequence of this is that $M$ is guaranteed to be positive semi-definite (PSD), and therefore define a valid metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distance measure/linear transform duality in LMNN has its own advantages. An important one is that the optimization problem can go back and forth between the $L$ and the $M$ representations, giving raise to a very efficient solution."

    "So, 1472 features! Those are quite many features indeed. In other words, the feature vectors at hand lie on a 1472-dimensional space. We cannot visualize in the input feature space how the feature vectors look like. However, in order to gain a little bit more of understanding of the data, we can apply dimension reduction, embed the feature vectors in a two-dimensional space, and plot the vectors in the embedded space. To this end, we are going to use one of the [many](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1EmbeddingConverter.html) methods for dimension reduction included in Shogun. In this case, we are using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (or [t-dsne](http://jmlr.org/papers/v9/vandermaaten08a.html)). This method is particularly suited to produce low-dimensional embeddings (two or three dimensions) that are straightforward to visualize."

Providing the results in the figure, we can rapidly draw the conclusion that the three classes of apes are somewhat easy to discriminate in the data set since the classes are more or less well separated in two dimensions. Note that t-dsne use randomness in the embedding process. Thus, the figure result of the experiment in the previous block of code will be different after different executions. Feel free to play around and observe the results after different runs! After this, it should be clear that the bonobos form most of the times a very compact cluster, whereas the chimpanzee and gorillas clusters are more spread. Also, there tends to be a chimpanzee (a green point) closer to the gorillas' cluster. This is probably a outlier in the data set."
