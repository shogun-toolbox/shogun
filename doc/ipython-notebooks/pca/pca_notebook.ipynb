The basic idea is to treat each image as a vector in a high dimensional space. Then, $\\text{PCA}$ is applied to the set of images to produce a new reduced subspace that captures most of the variability between the input images. The $\\text{Pricipal Component Vectors}$(eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix) are called the $\\text{Eigenfaces}$. Every input image can be represented as a linear combination of these eigenfaces by projecting the image onto the new eigenfaces space. Thus, we can perform the identfication process by matching in this reduced space. An input image is transformed into the $\\text{eigenspace,}$ and the nearest face is identified using a $\\text{Nearest Neighbour approach.}$"
