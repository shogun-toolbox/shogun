      "Cross validation aims to estimate an algorithm's performance on unseen data. For example, one might be interested in the average classification accuracy of a Support Vector Machine when being applied to new data, that it was not trained on. This is important in order to compare the performance different algorithms on the same target. Most crucial is the point that the data that was used for running/training the algorithm is not used for testing. Different algorithms here also can mean different parameters of the same algorithm. Thus, cross-validation can be used to tune parameters of learning algorithms, as well as comparing different families of algorithms against each other. Cross-validation estimates are related to the marginal likelihood in Bayesian statistics in the sense that using them for selecting models avoids overfitting."
