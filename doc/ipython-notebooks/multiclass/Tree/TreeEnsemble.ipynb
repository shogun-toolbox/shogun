    "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method in which a collection of decision trees are grown during training and the combination of the outputs of all the individual trees are considered during testing or application. The strategy for combination can be varied but generally, in case of classification, the mode of the output classes is used and, in case of regression, the mean of the outputs is used. The randomness in the method, as the method's name suggests, is infused mainly by the random subspace sampling done while training individual trees. While choosing the best split during tree growing, only a small randomly chosen subset of all the features is considered. The subset size is a user-controlled parameter and is usually the square root of the total number of available features. The purpose of the random subset sampling method is to decorrelate the individual trees in the forest, thus making the overall model more generic; i.e. decrease the variance without increasing the bias (see [bias-variance trade-off](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_dilemma)). The purpose of Random Forest, in summary, is to reduce the generalization error of the model as much as possible.    "

In the process, we will also learn how to use Shogun's [Random Forest class](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CRandomForest.html). For this purpose, we will use the [letter recognition dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition). This dataset contains pixel information (16 features) of 20000 samples of the English alphabet. This is a 26-class classification problem where the task is to predict the alphabet given the 16 pixel features. We start by loading the training dataset."
