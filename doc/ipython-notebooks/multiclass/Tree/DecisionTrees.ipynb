      "Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method that can be used for both classification and regression. Decision trees essentially encode a set of if-then-else rules which can be used to predict target variable given data features. These if-then-else rules are formed using the training dataset with the aim to satisfy as many training data instances as possible. The formation of these rules (aka. decision tree) from training data is called decision tree learning. Various decision tree learning algorithms have been developed and they work best in different situations. An advantage of decision trees is that they can model any type of function for classification or regression which other techniques cannot. But a decision tree is highly prone to overfitting and bias towards training data. So, decision trees are used for very large datasets which are assumed to represent the ground truth well. Additionally, certain [tree pruning algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_%28decision_trees%29) are also used to tackle overfitting.   "

      "ID3 is a straightforward decision tree learning algorithm developed by [Ross Quinlan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Quinlan). ID3 is applicable only in cases where the attributes (or features) defining data examples are categorical in nature and the data examples belong to pre-defined, clearly distinguishable (ie. well defined) classes. ID3 is an iterative greedy algorithm which starts with the root node and eventually builds the entire tree. At each node, the \"best\" attribute to classify data is chosen. The \"best\" attribute is chosen using the [information gain metric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_in_decision_trees). Once an attribute is chosen in a node, the data examples in the node are categorized into sub-groups based on the attribute values that they have. Basically, all data examples having the same attribute value are put together in the same sub-group. These sub-groups form the children of the present node and the algorithm is repeated for each of the newly formed children nodes. This goes on until all the data members of a node belong to the same class or all the attributes are exhausted. In the latter case, the class predicted may be erroneous and generally the mode of the classes appearing in the node is chosen as the predictive class. "

The tree growing process in case of C4.5 is same as that of ID3 i.e. finding the best split at each node using the [information gain metric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_in_decision_trees). But in case of continuous attribute, the C4.5 algorithm has to perform the additional step of converting it to a two-value categorical attribute by splitting about a suitable threshold. This threshold is chosen in a way such that the resultant split produces maximum information gain. Let us start exploring Shogun's C4.5 algorithm API with a toy example. "

      "The CART algorithm is a popular decision tree learning algorithm introduced by Breiman et al. Unlike ID3 and C4.5, the learnt decision tree in this case can be used for both multiclass classification and regression depending on the type of dependent variable. The tree growing process comprises of recursive binary splitting of nodes. To find the best split at each node, all possible splits of all available predictive attributes are considered. The best split is the one that maximises some splitting criterion. For classification tasks, ie. when the dependent attribute is categorical, the [Gini index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity) is used as the splitting criterion. For regression tasks, ie. when the dependent variable is continuous, the [least squares deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) is used. Let us learn about [Shogun's CART implementation](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CCARTree.html) by working on two toy problems, one on classification and the other on regression."

      "In the above code snippet, we see four parameters being supplied to the CART tree object. ```feat_types``` supplies knowledge of attribute types of training data to the CART algorithm and ```problem_type``` specifies whether it is a multiclass classification problem (```PT_MULTICLASS```) or a regression problem (```PT_REGRESSION```). The boolean parameter ```use_cv_pruning``` switches on cross-validation pruning  of the trained tree and ```num_folds``` specifies the number of folds of cross-validation to be applied while pruning. At this point, let us divert ourselves briefly towards undertanding what kind of pruning strategy is employed by Shogun's CART implementation. The CART algorithm uses the cost-complexity pruning strategy. Cost-Complexity pruning yields a list of subtrees of varying depths using complexity normalized resubstitution error, $R_\\alpha(T)$. Resubstitution error, R(T), measures how well a decision tree fits the training data. But, this measure favours larger trees over smaller ones. Hence the complexity normalized resubstitution error metric is used which adds penalty for increased complexity and in-turn counters overfitting.\n",

In this section, we will employ a different strategy i.e. cross validation. In cross-validation, we divide the training dataset into ```n``` subsets where ```n``` is a user controlled parameter. We perform ```n``` iterations of training and testing in which, at each iteration, we choose one of the ```n``` subsets as our test dataset and the remaining ```n-1``` subsets as our training dataset. The performance of the model is usually taken as the average of the performances in various iterations.

By setting a maximum allowed tree depth, we restrict the complexity of trained tree and hence avoid over-fitting. But choosing a low value of the maximum allowed tree depth may lead to early stopping i.e. under-fitting. Let us explore how we can decide the appropriate value of the max-allowed-tree-depth parameter. Let us create a method, which takes max-allowed-tree-depth parameter as input and returns the corresponding cross-validated error as output."

Hence, one of these should be the desired value. It is to be noted that the error metric that we are discussing here is the mean squared error. Thus, from the above plot, we can also claim that, given required parameters, our CART-flavoured decision tree can predict the rise time within an average error range of $\\pm0.5$ (i.e. square root of 0.25 which is the approximate minimum cross-validated error). The relative error i.e  ```average_error/range_of_labels``` comes out to be ~30%."

      "The CHAID is an algorithm for decision tree learning proposed by Kass (1980). It is similar in functionality to CART in the sense that both can be used for classification as well as regression. But unlike CART, CHAID internally handles only categorical features. The continuous features are first converted into ordinal categorical features for the CHAID algorithm to be able to use them. This conversion is done by binning of feature values.The number of bins (K) has to be supplied by the user. Given K, a predictor is split in such a way that all the bins get the same number (more or less) of distinct predictor values. The maximum feature value in each bin is used as a breakpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important parameter in the CHAID tree growing process is the p-value. The p-value is the metric that is used for deciding which categories of predictor values to merge during merging as well as for deciding the best attribute during splitting. The p-value is calculated using different hypothesis testing methods depending on the type of dependent variable (nominal, ordinal or continuous). A more detailed discussion on the CHAID algorithm can be found in the [documentation](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CCHAIDTree.html) of the ```CCHAIDTree``` class in Shogun. Let us move on to a more interesting topic which is learning to use CHAID using Shogun's python API.  "
