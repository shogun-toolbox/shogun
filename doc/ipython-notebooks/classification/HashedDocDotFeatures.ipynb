A token is defined as the minimum arbitrary sequence of characters that can be considered as atomic. Tokens depending on the choice of the user can be either whole words or n-grams, etc. A simple approach is to consider every possible token in your document collection as a different dimension in a feature space and then vectorize each document by assigning 1 to every dimension that corresponds to a token contained in that document and 0 to every other. This is the simpler approach and is known as the Boolean Vector Space Model. Another approach is, instead of using 1/0, to use a weight for every term, like their frequencies, but this is out of our scope.<br>\n",

For that purpose we created a dataset consisting of 10,000 documents for 5 different languages; English, Greek, German, Italian and Spanish. <br>The demo uses underneath it a svm model trained on 30,000 documents with Ngrams of size 4, bits of hash size = 18, quadratic features with options: 2-skips 3-grams and svm C = 0.1. The demo can be found here and you can test it on your own how well it does!"

      "For online algorithms or for cases when the data do not fit in memory there exist similar classes with the prefix \"Streaming\" that support reading examples from the disk and providing them to some algorithms one at a time. The classes specifically are StreamingHashedDocDotFeatures, StreamingHashedDenseFeatures and StreamingHashedSparseFeatures. If one has mixed features, that are not just numerical or not just text, then he can use the CombinedDotFeatures class to combine objects of the aforementioned classes!<br>Another option is to use the Vw* algorithms and the VwExample class that require the input to be in vw format and are a bit trickier to use."
