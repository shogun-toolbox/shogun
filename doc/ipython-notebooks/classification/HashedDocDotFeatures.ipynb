      "Document classification consists of assigning documents to specific predefined categories. This usually works by transforming the documents into a vector space that is acceptable by common classifiers, like SVMs, and then learning a model on that new representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common and the most widely used representation of document collections is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model\">Bag of Words</a> model.The BoW representation considers each document as a collection of tokens. A token is defined as the minimum arbitrary sequence of characters that can be considered as atomic. Tokens depending on the choice of the user can be either whole words or n-grams, etc. A simple approach is to consider every possible token in your document collection as a different dimension in a feature space and then vectorize each document by assigning 1 to every dimension that corresponds to a token contained in that document and 0 to every other. This is the simpler approach and is known as the Boolean Vector Space Model. Another approach is, instead of using {1,0}, to use a weight for every term, like their frequencies, but this is out of our scope.<br>\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's now consider a document collection consisting of the following documents:<br>\n",
      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Document 1</b> = \"This is the first document\"<br>\n",
      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Document 2</b> = \"Document classification: Introduction\"<br>\n",
      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Document 3</b> = \"A third document about classification\"<br>\n",
      "\n",
      "and suppose that we consider as tokens, every word that appears in the collection.<br>\n",
      "Then we would arrive to the following representation:\n",
      "<table><tr><td></td><td><b>Document 1</b></td><td><b>Document 2</b></td><td><b>Document 3</b></td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[0] this</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[1] is</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[2] the</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[3] first</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[4] document</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[5] classification</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[6] introduction</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[7] a</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[8] third</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",
      "    <tr><td>[9] about</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",
      "</table>\n",
      "The above matrix is called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix\">document-term matrix</a> and is widely used in Information Retrieval applications. In our case since every document is now represented by a numerical vector, we can just pass this as a dataset to common classifiers, including kernel machines. <br>\n",
      "<h3>Limitations on large scale collections</h3>\n",
      "Although the aformentioned procedure is pretty intuitive and straight-forward it has some drawbacks when considered on large collections of documents.<br>\n",
      "<ul><li>First of all, the dimensionality of the feature space (or else, the number of distinct tokens in the collection) is usually <b>not known beforehand</b> and requires a pass over the entire dataset to be calculated. This can make the creation of the document-term matrix trickier, especially in online learning scenarios.</li>\n",
      "    <li>Secondly, this dimensionality can grow to be <b>very large</b>; imagine considering as tokens the set of every possible word, or every possible 8-gram.</li>\n",
      "    <li>Thirdly, this approach requires an <b>additional dictionary</b> in order to work that maps every token to its appropriate dimension, for instance every appearance of 'this' above should always be mapped to dimension 0, and this mapping data structure will also grow to be <b>very large.</b></li></ul><br>\n",
      "<h3>The hashing response</h3>\n",
      "A convenient approach that eliminates all the problems that the BoW representation introduced is to use a hash function to transform all the tokens into numerical entities and then restrict those values into a range [0, n-1] using the modulo function. The values in the [0, n-1] range will correspond to indices on a n-dimensional document-term matrix.<br>This way: <ul>\n",
      "<li>the dimensionality of the target feature space is now <b>known beforehand</b>, as it's simply the number of all possible outcomes of the hash functions, restricted to a specific range [0, n-1] by using the modulo function. No extra passes over the dataset are needed this way.</li>\n",
      "<li>In addition, the dimension can now be <b>restricted to a certain size</b> that is convenient depending on the limitations of the available hardware</li>\n",
      "<li>The dictionary is also <b>not needed</b> anymore since each token is directly mapped to the appropriate dimension through the outcome of the hash function.</li></ul>\n",
      "\n",
      "The above approach will result in a hashed document-term matrix, similar to the one shown above, of a pre-defined dimension size (number of rows).<br>\n",
      "Each token will now be assigned to a random dimension, although always the same for the same token, that is determined from the hash function.<br> This will probably incure some collisions, but if the hash functions is good enough and our choice for the dimension size is sufficiently large it will not be a problem. Especially if we are considering large collections. <br>\n",
      "\n",
      "After the creation of the hashed document-term matrix, the intuition is to pass it as a dataset to a linear classifier that will take care of the rest!<br>\n",
      "<h3>On-the-fly Hashing</h3>\n",
      "A naive way to implement the hashing procedure is to pre-hash every token of the collection and store it to the disk for later access. However, this approach is not very convenient since it will require space analogous to the size of the original dimension. It will also make the experimentation on different parameters, like the size of the hash function or the choice of tokens, a bit trickier since one would have to re-convert the entire collection based on the choice of those parameters.<br>\n",
      "The response to that is to read our collection as it is and compute the hash of every token only when it's required, on-the-fly.<br>\n",
      "<h3>On-the-fly Hashing with Shogun</h3>\n",
      "We will now have a look at how the above idea is represented in the Shogun Toolbox. That is we will see how we can load our document collection in memory and consider a hashed document-term matrix with the hashing of every document (or token more specifically) happening on-the-fly, only when it's required to be computed. Altough it may sound a bit tricky, it's actually pretty straightforward and here is how.<br><br>\n",

      "The approach we have selected in Shogun for the text collections does not compute all the quadratic features, but only a subset of them defined using a k-skip n-grams rule. N-grams in this context refer to a collection of up to n consecutive tokens and should not be confused with our choice for what consists a token, where it can be whole words or ngrams themselves. The k-skip in front allows us to skip up to k tokens when we group them in up-to n sized groups. Although this is a simple idea it can be a bit confusing when introduced through a definition, so let's have a look at an example:\n",
      "Suppose we have the following <b>consecutive</b> tokens:<br>\n",
      "Tokens : [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]<br>\n",
      "and that we want to consider a 2-skip 2-grams approach. This means that we can combine up to 2 tokens (that is a single token or two tokens) while skipping up to 2 tokens between them (that means we can skip 0,1 and 2 tokens). Therefore, we obtain the following combinations: <br>\n",
