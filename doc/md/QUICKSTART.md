SHOGUN-TOOLBOX Quickstart   {#quickstart}
=========================

This quickstart assumes that you have access to standard unix/linux tools,
cmake and a C/C++ compiler.  It may be neccessary to install additional
libraries or header files to compile shogun or its interfaces.

## Build prerequisites

* Minimal requirements: standard utils like cmake, gcc/g++/clang, ldd,
  wget/curl, tar/bzip2, bash, grep, test, sed, cut, awk, ldd, uname, cat,
  python-2.7
* Optional libraries to improve performance: lapack3-dev, atlas3-headers,
  atlas3-base-dev, libeigen3-dev
* Depending on the enabled interfaces you may need: swig 2, r-base-dev,
  liboctave-dev, openjdk-6-jdk/openjdk-7-jdk, jblas, jblas-dev,
  python2.7-dev, python-numpy

## Download sources

The following commands will get the prepared shogun source archives.  Note
that some examples might depend on "shogun-data", which is approximately
250 MB of data to be downloaded.  The additional data is not required for
shogun itself, so you may skip downloading them.

	$ cd "$HOME"
	$ wget ftp://shogun-toolbox.org/shogun/releases/3.1/sources/shogun-3.1.1.tar.bz2
	$ tar xjf shogun-3.1.1.tar.bz2

	$ wget ftp://shogun-toolbox.org/shogun/data/shogun-data-0.7.tar.bz2
	$ tar xjf shogun-data-0.7.tar.bz2

	$ cd shogun-3.1.1
	$ rm -rv data/
	$ ln -s ../shogun-data-0.7 data

## Compile and install SHOGUN-TOOLBOX into home directory

We assume that you want to install shogun in a subdirectory `shogun-install` of
your user home.  Installing shogun to system-directories is possible as well,
but may require root/sudo privileges.

	$ cd "$HOME/shogun-3.1.1"

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..

	$ make -j5 all
	$ make install

## Run the examples

Many toy examples on can be found within `share/shogun/examples/libshogun`.
In order to run them, you need to point `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the location
of the compiled library.  If everything from above was successful, this
should work well:

	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/shogun-install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
	$ cd "$HOME/shogun-install/share/shogun/examples/libshogun"
	$ chmod +x ./so_multiclass_BMRM && ./so_multiclass_BMRM

# You know what you're doing?

A small cheat sheet of available cmake options.  This list does not
claim to be comprehensive -- it's meant to be a quick reference for
those you know what they do.

## Enabling modular interfaces
* `-DPythonModular=ON`, `-DOctaveModular=ON`, `-DJavaModular=ON`,
* `-DPerlModular=ON`, `-DRubyModular=ON`, `-DCSharpModular=ON`,
* `-DRModular=ON`, `-DLuaModular=ON`

## Enabling static interfaces (legacy)
* `-DCmdLineStatic=ON`, `-DPythonStatic=ON`, `-DOctaveStatic=ON`
* `-DMatlabStatic=ON`, `-DRStatic=ON`

## Handy cmake options
* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` or `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
* `-DENABLE_TESTING=ON` or `-DENABLE_TESTING=OFF`
* `-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=...`, `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=...`
