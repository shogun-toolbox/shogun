|python_modular    | mature (no known problems)                                |
|octave_modular    | mature (no known problems)                                |
|java_modular      | beta quality - not all examples are ported and working    |
|lua_modular       | alpha work in progress quality - some examples work       |
|ruby_modular      | pre-alpha work in progress quality - proof-of-concept only|
|csharp_modular    | pre-alpha work in progress quality - proof-of-concept only|
|r_modular         | pre-alpha quality (swig does not properly handle reference|
|                  | counting and thus only for the brave:                     |
|                  | --disable-reference-counting to get it to work, but beware|
|                  | that it will leak memory; disabled by default.)           |

|                  | that in one file interfaces with python,octave,r,matlab   |
|                  | and provides the run_python command to run code in python |
|                  | using the in octave,r,matlab available variables, etc)    |
