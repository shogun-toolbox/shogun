The following table depicts the status of each interface available in shogun:

+==================+===========================================================+
|    interface     |     status                                                |
+==================+===========================================================+
|python_modular    | mature (no known problems)                                |
|octave_modular    | mature (no known problems)                                |
|java_modular      | stable (no known problems; not all examples are ported)   |
|ruby_modular      | stable (no known problems; only few examples ported)      |
|csharp_modular    | stable (no known problems; not all examples are ported)   |
|lua_modular       | alpha (some examples work, string typemaps are unstable   |
|perl_modular      | pre-alpha work in progress quality                        |
|r_modular         | pre-alpha quality (swig does not properly handle reference|
|                  | counting and thus only for the brave:                     |
|                  | --disable-reference-counting to get it to work, but beware|
|                  | that it will leak memory; disabled by default.)           |

|elwms_static      | this is the eierlegendewollmilchsau interface, a chimera  |
|                  | that in one file interfaces with python,octave,r,matlab   |
|                  | and provides the run_python command to run code in python |
|                  | using the in octave,r,matlab available variables, etc)    |
