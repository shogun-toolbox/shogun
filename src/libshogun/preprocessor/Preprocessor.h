/** @brief Class Preprocessor defines a preprocessor interface.
 *
 * Preprocessors are transformation functions that don't change the domain of
 * the input features.  These functions can be applied in-place if the input
 * features fit in memory or can be applied on-the-fly when (depending on
 * features) a feature caching strategy is applied. However, if the individual
 * features are in \f$\bf{R}\f$ they have to stay in \f$\bf{R}\f$ although the
 * dimensionality of the feature vectors is allowed change.
 *
 * As preprocessors might need a certain initialization they may expect that
 * the init() function is called before anything else. The actual preprocessing
 * is feature type dependent and thus coordinated in the sub-classes, cf. e.g.
 * CSimplePreprocessor .
