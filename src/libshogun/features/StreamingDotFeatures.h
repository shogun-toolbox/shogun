/** @brief Streaming features that support dot products among other operations.
 *
 * DotFeatures support the following operations:
 *
 * - a way to obtain the dimensionality of the feature space, i.e. \f$\mbox{dim}({\cal X})\f$
 *
 * - dot product between feature vectors:
 *
 *   \f[r = {\bf x} \cdot {\bf x'}\f]
 *
 * - dot product between feature vector and a dense vector \f${\bf z}\f$:
 *
 *   \f[r = {\bf x} \cdot {\bf z}\f]
 *
 * - multiplication with a scalar \f$\alpha\f$ and addition to a dense vector \f${\bf z}\f$:
 *
 *   \f[ {\bf z'} = \alpha {\bf x} + {\bf z} \f]
 *
 * - iteration over all (potentially) non-zero features of \f${\bf x}\f$
 *
