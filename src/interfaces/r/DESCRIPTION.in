Description: SHOGUN - is a new machine learning toolbox with focus on large
        scale kernel methods and especially on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with focus
        to bioinformatics. It provides a generic SVM object interfacing to several
        different SVM implementations. Each of the SVMs can be combined with a variety
        of the many kernels implemented. It can deal with weighted linear combination
        of a number of sub-kernels, each of which not necessarily working on the same
        domain, where  an optimal sub-kernel weighting can be learned using Multiple
        Kernel Learning.  Apart from SVM 2-class classification and regression
        problems, a number of linear methods like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
        Linear Programming Machine (LPM), (Kernel) Perceptrons and also algorithms to
        train hidden markov models are implemented. The input feature-objects can be
        dense, sparse or strings and of type int/short/double/char and can be converted
        into different feature types. Chains of preprocessors (e.g.  substracting the
        mean) can be attached to each feature object allowing for on-the-fly
        pre-processing.
