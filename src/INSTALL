GENERAL

On most platforms (Linux,MacOSX,cygwin) it is sufficient to issue

./configure
make
sudo make install

which will build the shogun standalone version cmdline_static, and the
following shogun interfaces: r_static, matlab_static, python_static,
octave_static and octave_modular, python_modular, r_modular, java_modular
and csharp_modular. Finally it will also install shogun.

If you prefer to not run make install, you should instead include the shogun
library in your path:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:path_to_shogun/src/shogun/

Often you are just interested in one language and we always recommend to
use the more powerful modular interfaces.

If you want specific interfaces use,
e.g

./configure --interfaces=python_static,python_modular

See ./configure --help for additional options.

If this does not work for you, see the SPECIFIC BUILD INSTRUCTIONS below


SPECIAL FEATURES

To enable Multiple Kernel Learning with CPLEX(tm) just make sure cplex can
be found in the PATH. If it is not found shogun will resort to GLPK (if found)
for 1-norm MKL, p-norm MKL with p>1 will work nonetheless.

REQUIREMENTS

The standard linux utils like bash, grep, test, sed, cut, awk, ldd, uname gcc
g++ and cat, python (debian package: python2.5, python2.6) are required
for the ./configure to work.

To compile the R interface you need to have the R developer files 
(debian package r-base-dev) installed.

To compile the octave interface you need to have the octave developer files 
(debian package octave3.0-headers) installed.

To compile the java interface you need to have the java developer files 
(debian package openjdk-6-jdk) installed.

To compile the python interface you need to have the python developer files
installed (debian packages python2.5-dev or python2.6-dev) and numpy
version 1.x installed (debian package python-numpy) installed.

Optionally you will need atlas and lapack (debian packages lapack3-dev, 
atlas3-headers atlas3-base-dev or atlas3-altivec-dev atlas3-sse2-dev)
installed. Note that atlas/lapack is only supported under linux (high
performance computing should be done under linux only anyway). In case
atlas/lapack is unavailable, don't worry most of shogun will work without,
though slightly slower versions are used. For standard 1-norm
multiple kernel learning (MKL) the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) version at
least 4.29 or CPLEX is required. If you want to build the html documentation or
python online help you will need doxygen version 1.6.0 or higher.


SPECIFIC BUILD INSTRUCTIONS


BUILDING ON DEBIAN GNU LINUX

Python (python2.5 or python2.6) need to be installed.  To get atlas/lapack
optimizations optionally also install the atlas3-* packages aswell as the
lapack3-* packages.

standalone:
===========

cd src
./configure --interfaces=cmdline_static
make

a shogun executable can be found in interfaces/cmdline_static

In order to test the shogun standalone binary, you can run the following
commands from the project root directory:

cd examples/documented/cmdline_static
../../../src/interfaces/cmdline_static/shogun classifier_liblinear.sg

octave
======

To compile the octave interface you need to have the octave developer files 
(debian package octave3.2-headers or octave3.0-headers).

then do a

./configure --interfaces=octave_static
make
sudo make install

a sg.oct file should be created. as a test start octave in the
examples/documented/octave_static/ directory and type

addpath('../../../src/interfaces/octave_static/graphical')
svr_regression

matlab
======

To compile the matlab interface you need to have matlab installed in the path
(i.e., typing matlab in the shell should start matlab).

then do a

./configure --interfaces=matlab_static
make
sudo make install

a sg.mexglx (or sg.mexa64 or sg.mexmac etc file should be created in
interfaces/matlab_static/). As a test start matlab in the
examples/documented/matlab_static directory and type

addpath('../../../src/interfaces/matlab_static/graphical')
svr_regression

For permanent use you could add the following line to your matlab/startup.m 

    addpath('path_to_shogun/src/interfaces/matlab_static');

R
=

To compile the R interface you need to have the R developer files 
(debian package r-base-dev) installed.

then do the usual 

./configure --interfaces=r_static
make
sudo make install

python
======

To compile the python interface you need to have numpy version 1.x installed 
(debian package python-numpy and python-numpy-ext) and optionally for plotting
python-matplotlib installed. When using matplotlib, make sure you use numpy as
the underlying numeric toolkit, i.e. you have the line 

numerix      : numpy

in your /etc/matplotlibrc


then do a
./configure --interfaces=python_static
make

A sg.so file should be created in the src/interfaces/python_static directory:
To test whether it is working change to examples/documented/python_static/graphical
and run:

PYTHONPATH=path_to_shogun/src/interfaces/python_static/ python svm_classification.py

eierlegendewollmichsau (elwms) interface
========================================

This is a .so file that works with R,python,matlab,octave all in one. To compile
you should have at least python and some other interface enabled:

cd src
./configure --interfaces=octave_static,matlab_static,r_static,python_static,elwms_static
make
cd interfaces/elwms_static

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/octave/lib:/path/to/matlab/libs octave 

All examples from
examples/documented/{r_static,python_static,matlab_static,octave_static}/*
should work plus the ones in examples/documented/elwms_static/
(that allows lang -> python subcommands).

object oriented python/swig interface:
======================================

proceed as for the python interface but now in addition install the swig package and
configure+compile shogun with:

./configure --interfaces=python_modular
make
sudo make install

to test if it is working try python ../examples/documented/python_modular/graphical/svm.py

BUILDING ON MACOSX

python:
=======
Get the precompiled binary packages
python, matplotlib, NumPy and wxPython from http://pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/index.html

Note: On powerpc archs don't use gcc-4.0 / gcc-4.1 as it will fail with an internal compiler
error. Try gcc-4.2 instead or disable optimization (using -O0).
Furthermore there it *may* happen that compiling hangs with an error in
 /usr/include/architecture/ppc/math.h:513.
 
A workaround is to uncomment this in math.h:

 typedef struct __complex_s {
        double Real;
        double Imag;
 } __complex_t;
 
Also make sure you don't mix python versions (i.e. python2.5 and python2.6) on build/runtime.
You can specify the python version as a argument to configure, e.g.: --python=python2.7

./configure --interface=python_static
make

to test if it is working try:

PYTHONPATH=`pwd` python ../examples/documented/python/graphical/svm_classification.py

object oriented python/swig interface:
======================================
Follow the above instructions for python. Then use homebrew/fink/darwinports to install swig.

./configure --interfaces=python-modular
make
sudo make install

to test if it is working try python ../examples/documented/python_modular/graphical/svm.py

octave:
=======
Use fink/darwinports to install octave. For intel-macs octave currently is only in the
unstable repository + it has to be compiled from source. Also note that g77
 got replaced by gfortran, so you might need to do a fink install gcc4 first (which takes
 an endless amount time to compile).

then do:

./configure --interfaces=octave_modular
make

a sg.oct file should be created. as a test start octave in the src/ directory
and type

addpath('../examples/documented/octave/graphical')
svr_regression

standalone:
===========
cd src
./configure --interfaces=cmdline_modular
make
make install

The shogun executable can be found in /usr/local/bin/shogun and the libraries in
/usr/local/lib/libshogun*.

R:
==
Install the full R package (e.g. the 93MB R-2.4.0.dmg image from
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ )

then do the usual

./configure --interfaces=r_modular
make
make install

After starting the R aqua gui, choose File->Source File and select the
../examples/documented/r/graphical/svm_classification.R example

If that does not work out (send us a bug report) and also please try the following:

Enter the src/ directory and do:

./configure --interfaces=r_modular
make
make install
(if that fails attach the configure.log in the bug report)

a sg.so file should be created. To test if that file is OK try in the
r/ directory:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../libshogun R
>> dyn.load('sg.so')
sg <- function(...) .External("sg",...,PACKAGE="sg")
sg('help')

if that was still working go to the shogun/R directory and try
make clean
make

if a .tar.gz is successfully created, then the R CMD INSTALL <file>.tar.gz
should go through.

matlab:
=======

BUILDING ON WINDOWS / CYGWIN

	install cygwin 1.7 or later 

R:
==
I did not try the long and painful way of compiling R to get etc/Makeconf etc.
to be setup correctly. Thus the usual R CMD INSTALL <pkg> won't work (help welcome).

Instead install the R package from cran (i.e. using the R-2.4.0-win32.exe
		installer from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ )

Enter the src/ directory and do:

./configure --interfaces=r_modular
(if that fails attach the configure.log in the bug report)
make

a sg.dll file should be created. To test if that file is OK try in the
src/ directory:

R
>> dyn.load('sg.dll')
sg <- function(...) .External("sg",...,PACKAGE="sg")
sg('help')

Instead of using library(sg) in your .R scripts you now have to use 

dyn.load('<path_to_shogun>/sg.dll')
sg <- function(...) .External("sg",...,PACKAGE="sg").

After this modification, The examples in examples/documented/r/ should all work. To get
them to go start the R gui, choose File->Source R Code and select 
../examples/documented/r/graphical/svr_regression.R  (as this example has no other package dependencies).

matlab:
=======
	cd src
	./configure --interfaces=matlab_static
	make

	a sg.dll can be found in src/matlab

	startup matlab and type sg('help') 

standalone:
===========

	cd src
	./configure
	make
	make install

	a shogun.exe can be found in src/cmdline


octave:
=======

	install octave and octave-headers
	cd src
	./configure --interfaces=octave_static
	make
	make install

	a sg.oct file can be found in src/octave
	try

	cd src/octave
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../libshogun octave
	addpath('../examples/documented/octave/graphical')
	svr_regression


python:
=======

  install python2.5 and numpy >1.0
  
  now compile shogun:
	./configure --interfaces=python_static
	make
	make install

  this will create a sg.dll in the src/python dir

  to test if it is working, try:
	 cd src
	 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./libshogun PYTHONPATH=./python python ../examples/documented/python/graphical/svm_classification.py

object oriented python/swig interface:
======================================

do all of the above you did for python but now in addition install the swig
package and configure+compile shogun with:

 ./configure --interfaces=python_modular
  make
  make install

to test if it is working try python ../examples/documented/python_modular/graphical/svm.py

object oriented octave/swig interface:
======================================

do all of the above you did for octave but now in addition install the swig
package and configure+compile shogun with:

 ./configure --interfaces=octave_modular
  make
  make install

to test if it is working try octave ../examples/documented/octave_modular/libsvm.m

object oriented r/swig interface:
======================================

do all of the above you did for R but now in addition install the swig
package and configure+compile shogun with:

 ./configure --interfaces=r_modular
  make
  make install

to test if it is working try octave ../examples/documented/r_modular/all_classifier.R

object oriented java/swig interface:
======================================

do all of the above you did for java but now in addition install the swig
package and configure+compile shogun with:

 ./configure --interfaces=java_modular
  make
  make install

to test if it is working try 
export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/jblas.jar:SHOGUNDIR/src/java_modular/shogun.jar:.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=SHOGUNDIR/src/libshogun:SHOGUNDIR/src/java_modular
javac ../examples/documented/java_modular/classifier_libsvm_minimal_modular.java
and java classifier_libsvm_minimal_modular

PROBLEMS

In case header files or libraries are not at standard locations one needs
to manually adjust the libray/include paths using --includes or --libs
(see configure --help for additional options) 

The current mingw version in cygwin is out of date - so R and matlab won't work
until mingw is updated to gcc 4.X.
