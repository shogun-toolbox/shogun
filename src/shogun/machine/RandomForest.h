/** @brief This class implements the Random Forests algorithm. In Random Forests algorithm, we train a number of randomized CART trees
 * (see class CRandomCARTree) using the supplied training data. The number of trees to be trained is a parameter (called number of bags)
 * controlled by the user. Test feature vectors are classified/regressed by combining the outputs of all these trained candidate trees using a
 * combination rule (see class CombinationRule). The feature for calculating out-of-box error is also provided to help determine the
 * appropriate number of bags. The evaluatin criteria for calculating this out-of-box error is specified by the user (see class CEvaluation).
