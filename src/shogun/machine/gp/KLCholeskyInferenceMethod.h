/** @brief The KL approximation inference method class.

 * The class is implemented based on the KL method in the Challis's paper,
 * which uses full Cholesky represention.
 * Note that C is not unique according to the definition of C in the paper.

 * Code adapted from
 * http://hannes.nickisch.org/code/approxXX.tar.gz

 *
 * The adapted Matlab code can be found at
 * https://gist.github.com/yorkerlin/bb400ebded2dbe90c58d
 *
 * Note that "Cholesky" means Cholesky represention of the variational co-variance matrix
 * is explicitly used in inference
