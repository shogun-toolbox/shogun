/** @brief Neural layer with linear neurons, with an identity activation
 * function. can be used as a hidden layer or an output layer
 *
 * Each neuron in the layer is connected to all the neurons in all the layers
 * that connect into this layer.
 *
 * Activations for each train/test case are computed according to
 * \f$ b + \sum_i W_i x_i \f$ where \f$ b \f$ is the bias vector, \f$ W_i \f$
 * is the weights matrix between this layer and layer i of its inputs, and
 * \f$ x_i \f$ is the activations vector of layer i.
 *
 * The layout of the parameter vector of this layer is as follows:
 * 	- The first num_neurons elements correspond to the biases
 * 	- The following elements correspond to the weight matrices. For each layer
 * i that connects into this layer as input, a weight matrix of size
 * num_neurons*num_neurons_i is stored in column major format.
 *
 * When used as an output layer, a
 * [squared error measure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) is
 * used
