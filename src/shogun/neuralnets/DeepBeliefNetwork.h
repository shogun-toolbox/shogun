/** @brief A Deep Belief Network
 *
 * A [Deep Belief Network](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_belief_networks)
 * [Hinton, 2006] is a multilayer probabilistic generative models. It consists
 * of hidden layers and visible layers. The top hidden layer and the layer
 * below it form a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. The rest of
 * connections in the network are directed connections that go from a hidden
 * layer into a visible layer or another hidden layer.
 *
 * The network can be pre-trained by treating it as a stack of RBMs. Each hidden
 * layer along with the layer below it form an RBM. Each RBM
 * is then trained using (persistent) contrastive divergence. Pre-training often
 * provides a good initialization for the network's parameters.
 *
 * After pre-training, the parameters can be fine-tuned using a variant of the
 * wake-sleep algorithm [Hinton, 2006].
 *
 * The DBN can be used to initialize the parameters of a neural network using
 * convert_to_neural_network().
 *
 * Samples can be drawn from the model by starting with a random state for the
 * top hidden layer, performing some steps of Gibbs sampling in the top RBM to
 * obtain the states of the top hidden layer and then using those to infer the
 * states of the lower layers using a down-pass.
 *
 * Steps for using the DBN class:
 * 	- Specify the number of visible units and their type using the constructor
 * 	- Add the hidden layers using add_visible_layer() and add_hidden_layer().
 * 	- Initialize the DBN using initialize_neural_network()
 * 	- Pre-train the DBN using pre_train()
 * 	- Optionally do some unsupervised fine-tuning using train()
 * 	- If needed, call convert_to_neural_network() to convert the DBN into a
 * neural network
