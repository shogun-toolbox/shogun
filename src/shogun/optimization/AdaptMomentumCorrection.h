/** @brief This implements the adaptive momentum correction method.
 *
 * A standard momentum correction performs update based on a momentum (eg, \f$\mu\f$), a previous descend direction (eg, \f$v\f$) and a
 * current descend direction (eg, \f$d\f$).
 *
 * The idea of adaptive momentum correction method is
 * If signs of the last two momentum corrections are different, the current descend direction is discounted
 * On the other hand, if the the signs are the same, the method raises the current descend direction 
 * Please see method get_corrected_descend_direction() for details
