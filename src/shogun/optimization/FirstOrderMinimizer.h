 *
 * This class gives the interface of a first-order gradient-based unconstrained minimizer
 *
 * This kind of minimizers will find optimal target variables based on gradient information wrt target variables.
 * For example, the gradient descend method is a minimizer.
 *
 * A minimizer requires the following objects as input:
 * a supported cost function object (eg, FirstOrderCostFunction )
 * a penalty object if regularization is enabled (eg, Penalty )
