/** @brief This implements the Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) correction.
 *
 * Given a target variable, \f$w\f$, and a descend direction, \f$d_{ahead}\f$ wrt \f$w_{ahead}\f$,
 * the momentum method performs the following update:
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *   w_{ahead} &=&  w + \mu v \\
 *   v^{new}   &=& \mu v - d_{ahead} \\
 *   w^{new}   &=& w + v^{new} 
 * \f}
 * where \f$\mu\f$ is a momentum, \f$d_{ahead}\f$ is descend direction wrt \f$w_{ahead}\f$
 * (eg, \f$ d_{ahead}=\lambda g_{ahead}\f$, where \f$\lambda\f$ is learning rate, \f$g_{ahead}\f$ is gradient wrt \f$w_{ahead}\f$),
 * \f$v\f$ is a previous descend direction, and \f$v^{new}\f$ is a corrected descend direction.
 *
 * Note that the Nesterov momentum correction makes use of \f$d_{ahead}\f$  instead of \f$d\f$.
 *
 * In practice, we use the following implementation:
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *   v^{old} &=& v \\
 *   v^{new} &=& \mu  v^{old} - d \\
 *   w^{new} &=& w - \mu  v^{old} + (1 + \mu) v^{new}
 * \f}
 * where \f$d\f$ is descend direction wrt \f$w\f$
 *
 * The trick used in this implementation is we store \f$w_{ahead}\f$ and rename it as \f$w\f$.
 * Given a decay descend direction (eg, \f$d=\lambda g_{ahead}\f$, where \f$\lambda\f$ is a decay learning rate), \f$w_{ahead}\f$ is very close to \f$w\f$. 
 * When an optimal solution \f$w^{opt}\f$ is found, \f$w_{ahead}=w^{opt}\f$ since \f$d^{opt}=0\f$
 *
 * The get_corrected_descend_direction() method will do 
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *   v^{old} &=& v \\
 *   v^{new} &=& \mu  v^{old} - d
 * \f}
 * and return \f$ -\mu  v^{old} + (1 + \mu) v^{new}\f$
 *
 * A good introduction to the momentum update can be found at
 * http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#sgd
 *
 * If you read the introduction at http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#sgd ,
 * you may know that \f$v\f$ is also called velocity.
