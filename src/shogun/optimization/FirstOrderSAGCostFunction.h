/** @brief The class is about a stochastic cost function for stochastic average minimizers.
 *
 * The cost function must be written as a finite sample-specific sum of cost.  
 * For example, least squares cost function,
 * \f[
 * f(w)=\frac{ \sum_i^n{ (y_i-w^T x_i)^2 } }{2}
 * \f]
 * where \f$n\f$ is the sample size,
 * \f$(y_i,x_i)\f$ is the i-th sample,
 * \f$y_i\f$ is the label and \f$x_i\f$ is the features 
 *
 * A stochastic average minimizer uses average sample gradients ( get_average_gradient() )
 * to reduce variance related to stochastic gradients.
 *
 * Well known stochastic average methods are:
 * SVRG, Johnson, Rie, and Tong Zhang.
 * "Accelerating stochastic gradient descent using predictive variance reduction."
 * Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2013.
 *
 * SAG, Schmidt, Mark, Nicolas Le Roux, and Francis Bach.
 * "Minimizing finite sums with the stochastic average gradient."
 * arXiv preprint arXiv:1309.2388 (2013).
 *
 * SAGA, Defazio, Aaron, Francis Bach, and Simon Lacoste-Julien.
 * "SAGA: A fast incremental gradient method with support for non-strongly convex composite objectives."
 * Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2014.
 *
 * SDCA, Shalev-Shwartz, Shai, and Tong Zhang.
 * "Stochastic dual coordinate ascent methods for regularized loss."
