/** @brief This implements the plain momentum correction.
 *
 * Given a target variable, \f$w\f$, and a current descend direction, \f$d\f$,
 * the momentum method performs the following update:
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *  v^{new} &=& \mu v - d \\
 *  w^{new} &=& w + v^{new}
 *  \f}
 * where \f$\mu\f$ is a momentum, \f$v\f$ is a previous descend direction, \f$d\f$ is a current descend direction
 * (eg, \f$d=\lambda g\f$, where \f$\lambda\f$ is a learn rate, \f$g\f$ is gradient),
 * and \f$v^{new}\f$ is a corrected descend direction.
 *
 * The get_corrected_descend_direction() method will do 
 * \f[
 *  v^{new} = \mu v -  d
 * \f]
 * and return \f$v^{new}\f$
 *
 * A good introduction to the momentum update can be found at
 * http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#sgd
 *
 * If you read the introduction at http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#sgd ,
 * you may know that \f$v\f$ is also called velocity.
