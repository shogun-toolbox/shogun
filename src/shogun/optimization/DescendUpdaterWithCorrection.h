/** @brief This is a base class for descend update with descend based correction.
 *
 * The class enables descend update with descend-based correction.
 *
 * Given a target variable, \f$w\f$, and its negative descend direction \f$g\f$,
 * the class will first correct the descend direction, \f$g\f$, and then update \f$w\f$
 * based on \f$g^{corrected}\f$ (eg, subtracting \f$g^{corrected}\f$)
 *
 * Note that an example of \f$d\f$ is to simply use the gradient wrt \f$w\f$. 
 * An example of using descend based correction can be found at StandardMomentumCorrection
