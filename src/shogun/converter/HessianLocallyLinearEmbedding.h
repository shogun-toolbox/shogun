/** @brief class HessianLocallyLinearEmbedding used to preprocess
 * data using Hessian Locally Linear Embedding algorithm as described in
 *
 * Donoho, D., & Grimes, C. (2003).
 * Hessian eigenmaps: new tools for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
 * Proceedings of National Academy of Science (Vol. 100, pp. 5591-5596).
 *
 * Be sure k value is set with at least
 * 1+[target dim]+1/2 [target_dim]*[1 + target dim], e.g.
 * greater than 6 for target dimensionality of 2.
 *
 * Uses implementation from the Tapkee library.
 *
 * To use this converter with static interfaces please refer it by
 * sg('create_converter','hlle',k);
