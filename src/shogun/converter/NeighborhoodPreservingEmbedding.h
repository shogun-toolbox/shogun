/** @brief NeighborhoodPreservingEmbedding converter used to
 * construct embeddings as described in:
 *
 * He, X., Cai, D., Yan, S., & Zhang, H.-J. (2005).
 * Neighborhood preserving embedding.
 * Tenth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision ICCV05 Volume 1, 2, 1208-1213. Ieee.
 * Retrieved from http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1544858
 *
 * This method is hardly applicable to very high-dimensional data due to
 * necessity to solve eigenproblem involving matrix of size (dim x dim).
 *
 * Uses implementation from the Tapkee library.
 *
 * To use this converter with static interfaces please refer it by
 * sg('create_converter','npe',k);
