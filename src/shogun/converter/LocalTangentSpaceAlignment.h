/** @brief class LocalTangentSpaceAlignment (part of the Efficient
 * Dimensionality Reduction Toolkit) used to embed
 * data using Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA)
 * algorithm as described in:
 *
 * Zhang, Z., & Zha, H. (2002). Principal Manifolds
 * and Nonlinear Dimension Reduction via Local Tangent Space Alignment.
 * Journal of Shanghai University English Edition, 8(4), 406-424. SIAM.
 * Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0212008
 *
 * Due to performance reasons on high-dimensional datasets please
 * use KernelLocalTangentSpaceAlignment with linear kernel.
 *
 * The stated eigenproblem is solved in the same way as
 * CLocallyLinearEmbedding (LAPACK or ARPACK if available).
 *
 * The local tangent space alignment step is parallel. Neighborhood
 * determination is parallel as in CLocallyLinearEmbedding.
 *
 * This algorithm is pretty stable for variations of k parameter value but
 * be sure it is set with a consistent value (at least 3-5) for reasonable
 * results.
 *
 * Please do not use multithreading whether your LAPACK is not thread-safe.
