/** @brief The class Features is the base class of all feature objects.
 *
 * It can be understood as a dense real valued feature matrix (with e.g.
 * columns as single feature vectors), a set of strings, graphs or any other
 * arbitrary collection of objects. As a result this class is kept very general
 * and implements only very weak interfaces to
 *
 * - duplicate the Feature object
 * - obtain the feature type (like F_DREAL, F_SHORT ...)
 * - obtain the feature class (like Simple dense matrices, sparse or strings)
 * - obtain the number of feature "vectors"
 *
 *   In addition it provides helpers to check e.g. for compability of feature objects.
 *
 *   Currently there are 3 general feature classes, which are CSimpleFeatures
 *   (dense matrices), CSparseFeatures (sparse matrices), CStringFeatures (a
 *   set of strings) from which all the specific features like CSimpleFeatures<float64_t>
 *   (dense real valued feature matrices) are derived.
 *
 *   Subsets may be supported by inheriting classes.
 *   Sub-classes may want to overwrite the subset_changed_post() method which is
 *   called automatically after each subset change
