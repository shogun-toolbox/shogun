/** @brief The class CombinedFeatures is used to combine a number of of feature objects
 * into a single CombinedFeatures object.
 *
 * It keeps pointers to the added sub-features and is especially useful to
 * combine kernels working on different domains (c.f. CombinedKernel) and to
 * combine kernels looking at independent features.
 *
 * Subsets are supported: All actions will just be given through to all
 * sub-features. Only once per sub-feature instance, i.e. if there are two
 * sub-features that are the same instance, the subset action will only be
 * performed once.
