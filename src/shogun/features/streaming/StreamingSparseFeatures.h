/** @brief This class implements streaming features with sparse feature vectors.
 * The vector is represented as an SGSparseVector<T>. Each entry is of type
 * SGSparseVectorEntry<T> with members `feat_index' and `entry'.
 *
 * This class expects the input from the StreamingFile object to be zero-based,
 * i.e., a feature entered as 1:6.5 would have feat_index=0 and entry=6.5.
 *
 * The current example is stored as a combination of current_vector
 * and current_label.
 * current_num_features stores the highest dimensionality of examples encountered
 * upto the point of the function call.
 * For example, if the first example is '1:6.5 7:10.0', then current_num_features
 * would be 7 after the first function call.
 *
 * Since the dimensionality of the feature space is not immediately known initially,
 * current_num_features may increase as more examples are processed and larger
 * dimensions are seen.
 * For this purpose, `expand_if_required()' is provided which when called with a
 * dynamically allocated float or double array and the length, reallocates that
 * array to the new dimensionality (if necessary), setting the newer dimensions
 * to zero, and updates the length parameter to equal the new length of the array.
