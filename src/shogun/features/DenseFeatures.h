/** @brief The class DenseFeatures implements dense feature matrices.
 *
 * The feature matrices are stored en-block in memory in fortran order, i.e.
 * column-by-column, where a column denotes a feature vector.
 *
 * There are get_num_vectors() many feature vectors, of dimension
 * get_num_features(). To access a feature vector call
 * get_feature_vector() and when you are done treating it call
 * free_feature_vector(). While free_feature_vector() is a NOP in most cases
 * feature vectors might have been generated on the fly (due to a number
 * preprocessors being attached to them).
 *
 * From this template class a number the following dense feature matrix types
 * are used and supported:
 *
 * \li bool matrix - DenseFeatures<bool>
 * \li 8bit char matrix - DenseFeatures<char>
 * \li 8bit Byte matrix - DenseFeatures<uint8_t>
 * \li 16bit Integer matrix - DenseFeatures<int16_t>
 * \li 16bit Word matrix - DenseFeatures<uint16_t>
 * \li 32bit Integer matrix - DenseFeatures<int32_t>
 * \li 32bit Unsigned Integer matrix - DenseFeatures<uint32_t>
 * \li 32bit Float matrix - DenseFeatures<float32_t>
 * \li 64bit Float matrix - DenseFeatures<float64_t>
 * \li 64bit Float matrix <b>in a file</b> - CRealFileFeatures
 * \li 64bit Tangent of posterior log-odds (TOP) features from HMM - CTOPFeatures
 * \li 64bit Fisher Kernel (FK) features from HMM - CTOPFeatures
 * \li 96bit Float matrix - DenseFeatures<floatmax_t>
 *
 * Partly) subset access is supported for this feature type.
 * Dense use the (inherited) add_subset(), remove_subset() functions.
 * If done, all calls that work with features are translated to the subset.
 * See comments to find out whether it is supported for that method.
 * See also Features class documentation
