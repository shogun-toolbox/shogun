/** @brief Kernel independence test base class. Provides an interface for
 * performing an independence test. Given samples \f$Z=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^m\f$
 * from the joint distribution \f$\textbf{P}_{xy}\f$, does the joint
 * distribution factorize as \f$\textbf{P}_{xy}=\textbf{P}_x\textbf{P}_y\f$,
 * i.e. product of the marginals?
 *
 * The null-hypothesis says yes, i.e. no dependence, the alternative hypothesis
 * says no.
 *
 * In this class, this is done using a single kernel for each of the two sets
 * of samples
 *
 * The class also re-implements the sample_null() method. If the underlying
 * kernel is a custom one (precomputed), the rows and column of the kernel
 * matrix for p is permuted using subsets. The computation falls back to
 * CIndependenceTest::sample_null() otherwise, which requires to re-compute
 * the kernel in each iteration via subsets on the features instead
 *
 * Abstract base class.
