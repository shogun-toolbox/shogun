/** @brief This class implements the quadratic time Maximum Mean Statistic as
 * described in [1].
 * The MMD is the distance of two probability distributions \f$p\f$ and \f$q\f$
 * in a RKHS
 * \f[
 * \text{MMD}[\mathcal{F},p,q]^2=\textbf{E}_{x,x'}\left[ k(x,x')\right]-
 * 2\textbf{E}_{x,y}\left[ k(x,y)\right]
 * +\textbf{E}_{y,y'}\left[ k(y,y')\right]=||\mu_p - \mu_q||^2_\mathcal{F}
 * \f]
 *
 * Given two sets of samples \f$\{x_i\}_{i=1}^m\sim p\f$ and
 * \f$\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n\sim q\f$
 * the (unbiased) statistic is computed as
 *
 * \f[
 * \text{MMD}_u^2[\mathcal{F},X,Y]=\frac{1}{m(m-1)}\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j\neq i}^m
 * k(x_i,x_j) + \frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\neq i}^nk(y_i,y_j) - \frac{2}{mn}\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^nk(x_i,y_j)
 * \f]
 *
 * A biased version is
 *
 * \f[
 * \text{MMD}_b^2[\mathcal{F},X,Y]=\frac{1}{m^2}\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^m
 * k(x_i,x_j) + \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^nk(y_i,y_j) -
 * \frac{2}{mn}\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^nk(x_i,y_j)
 * \f]
 *
 * The type (biased/unbiased) can be selected via set_statistic_type().
 * Note that computing the statistic returns m*MMD; same holds for the null
 * distribution samples.
 *
 * Along with the statistic comes a method to compute a p-value based on
 * different methods. Sampling from null is also possible. If unsure which one to
 * use, sampling with 250 permutation iterations always is correct (but slow).
 *
 * To choose, use set_null_approximation_method() and choose from.
 *
 * If you do not know about your data, but want to use the MMD from a kernel
 * matrix, just use the custom kernel constructor. Everything else will work as
 * usual.
 *
 * MMD2_SPECTRUM: for a fast, consistent test based on the spectrum of the kernel
 * matrix, as described in [2]. Only supported if LAPACK is installed.
 *
 * MMD2_GAMMA: for a very fast, but not consistent test based on moment matching
 * of a Gamma distribution, as described in [2].
 *
 * PERMUTATION: For permuting available samples to sample null-distribution
 *
 * For kernel selection see CMMDKernelSelection.
