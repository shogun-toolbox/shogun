 * computed by the first method.
 * The p-value represents the position of the statistic in the null-distribution,
 * i.e. the distribution of the statistic population given the null-hypothesis
 * is true. (1-position = p-value).
 * The third method,  compute_threshold(), computes a threshold for a given
 * test level which is needed to reject the null-hypothesis.
 *
 * Also provides an interface for sampling from the null-distribution.
 * The actual sampling has to be implemented in sub-classes.
 *
 * All statistical tests should inherit from this class.
