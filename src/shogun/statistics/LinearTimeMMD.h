/** @brief This class implements the linear time Maximum Mean Statistic as
 * described in [1]. This statistic is in particular suitable for streaming
 * data. Therefore, only streaming features may be passed. To process other
 * feature types, construct streaming features from these (see constructor
 * documentations). A blocksize has to be specified that determines how many
 * examples are processed at once. This should be set as large as available
 * memory allows to ensure faster computations.
 *
 * The MMD is the distance of two probability distributions \f$p\f$ and \f$q\f$
 * in a RKHS.
 * \f[
 * \text{MMD}}[\mathcal{F},p,q]^2=\textbf{E}_{x,x'}\left[ k(x,x')\right]-
 * 2\textbf{E}_{x,y}\left[ k(x,y)\right]
 * +\textbf{E}_{y,y'}\left[ k(y,y')\right]=||\mu_p - \mu_q||^2_\mathcal{F}
 * \f]
 *
 * Given two sets of samples \f$\{x_i\}_{i=1}^m\sim p\f$ and
 * \f$\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n\sim q\f$
 * the (unbiased) statistic is computed as
 * \f[
 * \text{MMD}_l^2[\mathcal{F},X,Y]=\frac{1}{m_2}\sum_{i=1}^{m_2}
 * h(z_{2i},z_{2i+1})
 * \f]
 * where
 * \f[
 * h(z_{2i},z_{2i+1})=k(x_{2i},x_{2i+1})+k(y_{2i},y_{2i+1})-k(x_{2i},y_{2i+1})-
 * k(x_{2i+1},y_{2i})
 * \f]
 * and \f$ m_2=\lfloor\frac{m}{2} \rfloor\f$.
 *
 * Along with the statistic comes a method to compute a p-value based on a
 * Gaussian approximation of the null-distribution which is also possible in
 * linear time and constant space. Bootstrapping, is also possible (no
 * permutations but new examples will be used here).
 * If unsure which one to use, bootstrapping with 250 iterations always is
 * correct (but slow). When the sample size is large (>1000) at least,
 * the Gaussian approximation is an accurate and much faster choice than
 * bootstrapping.
 *
 * To choose, use set_null_approximation_method() and choose from
 *
 * MMD1_GAUSSIAN: Approximates the null-distribution with a Gaussian. Only use
 * from at least 1000 samples.
 *
 * BOOTSTRAPPING: For permuting available samples to sample null-distribution
 *
 * Comes with a method for selecting kernel weights, if a combined kernel on
 * combined features is used. See optimize_kernel_weights(). See [2]
 *
 * A very basic method for kernel selection when using CGaussianKernel is to
 * use the median distance of the underlying data. See examples how to do that.
 * More advanced methods will follow in the near future. However, the median
 * heuristic works in quite some cases. See [1].
