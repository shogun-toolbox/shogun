/** @brief Independence test base class. Provides an interface for performing an
 * independence test. Given samples \f$Z=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^m\f$ from the joint
 * distribution \f$\textbf{P}_x\textbf{P}_y\f$, does the joint distribution
 * factorize as \f$\textbf{P}_{xy}=\textbf{P}_x\textbf{P}_y\f$? The null-
 * hypothesis says yes, i.e. no independence, the alternative hypothesis says
 * yes.
 *
 * In this class, this is done using a single kernel for each of the two sets
 * of samples
 *
 * The class also re-implements the bootstrap_null() method. If the underlying
 * kernel is a custom one (precomputed), the
 *
 * Abstract base class.
