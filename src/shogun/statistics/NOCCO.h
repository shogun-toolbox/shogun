/** @brief This class implements the NOrmalized Cross Covariance Operator
 * (NOCCO) based independence test as described in [1].
 *
 * The test of independence is performed as follows: Given samples \f$Z=\{(x_i,
 * y_i)\}_{i=1}^n\f$ from the joint distribution \f$\textbf{P}_{XY}\f$,
 * does the joint distribution factorize as \f$\textbf{P}_{XY}=\textbf{P}_X
 * \textbf{P}_Y\f$? The null hypothesis says yes and the alternative hypothesis
 * says no.
 *
 * The dependence of the random variables \f$\mathbf X=\{x_i\}\f$ and \f$
 * \mathbf Y=\{y_i\}\f$ can be measured via the cross-covariance operator
 * \f$\boldsymbol\Sigma_{YX}\f$ which becomes \f$\mathbf{0}\f$ if and only if
 * \f$\mathbf X\f$ and \f$\mathbf Y\f$ are independent. This term factorizes as
 * \f$\boldsymbol\Sigma_{YX}=\boldsymbol\Sigma_{YY}^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{V}_
 * {YX}\boldsymbol\Sigma_{XX}^{\frac{1}{2}}\f$, where \f$\boldsymbol\Sigma_
 * {XX}\f$ and \f$\boldsymbol\Sigma_{YY}\f$ are known as covariance operator and
 * \f$\mathbf{V}_{YX}\f$ is known as normalized cross-covariance operator. The
 * paper uses the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of \f$\mathbf V_{YX}\f$ as a dependence
 * measure of the independence test (see paper for theroretical details).
 *
 * This class overrides the compute_statistic() method of the superclass which
 * computes an unbiased estimate of the normalized cross covariance operator
 * norm. Given the kernels \f$K\f$ (for \f$\mathbf X\f$) and \f$L\f$ (for
 * \f$\mathbf Y\f$), if we denote the doubly centered Gram matrices as
 * \f$\mathbf{G}_X=\mathbf{HKH}\f$ and \f$\mathbf{G}_Y=\mathbf{HLH}\f$
 * (where \f$\mathbf H=\mathbf I-\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}\f$), then the operator
 * norm is estimated as
 * \f[
 *	\hat{I}^{\text{NOCCO}}=\text{Trace}\left[\mathbf{R_X R_Y}\right]
 * \f]
 * where \f$\mathbf{R}_X=\mathbf{G}_X(\mathbf{G}_X+n\varepsilon_n\mathbf{I})
 * ^{-1}\f$ and \f$\mathbf{R}_Y=\mathbf{G}_Y(\mathbf{G}_Y+n\varepsilon_n
 * \mathbf{I})^{-1}\f$ and \f$\varepsilon_n\gt 0\f$ is a regularization
 * constant.
 *
 * In order to avoid computing direct inverse in the above terms for avoiding
 * numerical issues, this class uses Cholesky decomposition of matrices
 * \f$\mathbf{GG}_*=\mathbf{LL}^\top\f$ (where \f$\mathbf{GG}_*=(\mathbf{G}_*+
 * n\varepsilon_n\mathbf{I})^{-1}\f$) and solve systems \f$\mathbf{GG}_*
 * \mathbf x_i=\mathbf{LL}^\top\mathbf x_i=\mathbf e_i\f$ (\f$\mathbf e_i\f$
 * being the \f$i^{\text{th}}\f$ column of \f$\mathbf I_n\f$) one by one. On
 * the fly it then uses the solution vectors \f$\mathbf x_i\f$ to compute the
 * matrix-matrix product \f$\mathbf C_*=\mathbf G_*\mathbf{GG}_*^{-1}\f$
 * using \f$\mathbf C_{*,(j,i)}=\mathbf G_{*,j}\cdot \mathbf x_i\f$, where
 * $\mathbf G_{*,j}$ is the \f$j^{\text{th}}\f$ row of \f$\mathbf G_*$ (or
 * column, since it is symmetric) and then discarding the vector.
 *
 * The final trace computation is also simplified using the symmetry of the
 * matrices \f$\mathbf R_X\f$ and \f$\mathbf R_Y\f$. Computation of the off-
 * diagonal elements are avoided using
 * \f[
 *	\text{Trace}\left[\mathbf R_X \mathbf R_Y\right ]=\sum_{i=1}^n
 *	\mathbf R_X^i\cdot \mathbf R_Y^i
 * \f]
 *
 * For performing the independence test, ::PERMUTATION test is used by first
 * randomly shuffling the samples from one of the distributions while keeping
 * the samples from the other distribution in the original order. This way we
 * sample the null distribution and compute p-value and threshold for a given
 * test power.
