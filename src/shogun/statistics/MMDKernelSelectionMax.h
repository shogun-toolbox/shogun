/** @brief Kernel selection class that selects the single kernel that maximises
 * the MMD statistic. Works for CQuadraticTimeMMD and CLinearTimeMMD. This leads
 * to a heuristic that is better than the standard median heuristic for
 * Gaussian kernels. However, it comes with no guarantees.
 *
 * Optimal selection of single kernels can be found in the class
 * CMMDKernelSelectionOpt
 *
 * This method was first described in
 * Sriperumbudur, B., Fukumizu, K., Gretton, A., Lanckriet, G. R. G.,
 * & Schoelkopf, B.
 * Kernel choice and classifiability for RKHS embeddings of probability
 * distributions. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (2009).
