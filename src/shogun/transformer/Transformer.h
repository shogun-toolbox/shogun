	/** @brief class Transformer defines a transformer interface
	 *
	 * Transformers are transformation functions that transform input features
	 * to another features instance. As transformers might need a certain
	 * training on a training set (e.g. learning parameters), they may expect
	 * that the fit() function is called before anything else. The actual
	 * transformations happen in the transform() function, which returns the
	 * transformed features as a new Features instance. transform() can work
	 * either
	 * in-place or out-of-place. The underlying data is shared and modified if
	 * supported is in-place mode.
	 *
	 * This class defines generic interface for transformers, fit() and
	 * transform().
	 * Subclasses should override fit(std::shared_ptr<Features>) or fit(std::shared_ptr<Features>, Labels*)
	 * if necessary and transform() that transform transformation to features.
	 *
	 * Note that a new Features is always created even in in-place mode because
	 * Features is immutable.
