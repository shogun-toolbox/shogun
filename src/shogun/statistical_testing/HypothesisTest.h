/**
 * @brief Hypothesis test base class. Provides an interface for statistical
 * hypothesis testing via three methods: compute_statistic(), compute_p_value()
 * and compute_threshold(). The second computes a p-value for the statistic
 * computed by the first method. The p-value represents the position of the
 * statistic in the null-distribution, i.e. the distribution of the statistic
 * population given the null-hypothesis is true. (1-position = p-value).
 *
 * The third method,  compute_threshold(), computes a threshold for a given
 * test level which is needed to reject the null-hypothesis.
 *
 * Also provides an interface for sampling from the null-distribution.
 * The actual sampling has to be implemented in sub-classes.
 *
 * All statistical tests should inherit from this class.
 *
 * Abstract base class.
