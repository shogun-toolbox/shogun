/**
 * @brief This class implements the quadratic time Maximum Mean Statistic as
 * described in [1].
 * The MMD is the distance of two probability distributions \f$p\f$ and \f$q\f$
 * in a RKHS which we denote by
 * \f[
 * 	\hat{\eta_k}=\text{MMD}[\mathcal{F},p,q]^2=\textbf{E}_{x,x'}
 * 	\left[ k(x,x')\right]-2\textbf{E}_{x,y}\left[ k(x,y)\right]
 * 	+\textbf{E}_{y,y'}\left[ k(y,y')\right]=||\mu_p - \mu_q||^2_\mathcal{F}
 * \f]
 *
 * Estimating variance of the asymptotic distribution of the statistic under
 * null and alternative hypothesis can be done using compute_variance_h0() and
 * compute_variance_h1() method.
 *
 * Note that all these operations can be done for multiple kernels
 * at once as well. To use this functionality, use multikernel() method to
 * obtain a MultiKernelQuadraticTimeMMD instance and then call methods on that.
 *
 * If you do not know about your data, but want to use the MMD from a kernel
 * matrix, just use the custom kernel constructor and initialize the features as
 * CDummyFeatures. Everything else will work as usual.
 *
 * To make the computation faster, this class always pre-computes the kernel
 * and stores the Gram matrix using merged samples from p and q. It essentially
 * keeps a backup of the old kernel and rather uses this pre-computed one as
 * long as the present kernel is valid. Therefore, after a computation phase
 * is executed, upon calling get_kernel() we will obtain the pre-computed
 * kernel matrix as a CustomKernel object. However, if subsequently the
 * features are updated or the underlying kernel itself is updated, it discards
 * the pre-computed kernel matrix (frees memory) and pulls the old kernel from
 * backup (or, simply replace that if a new kernel is provided) and then
 * pre-computes that in the next run.
 *
 * It is possible to turn off the above feature by turning it off. However,
 * it will affect the performance of the algorithms, since they are optimzied
 * for pre-computed kernel matrices. Therefore, this should only be turned off
 * if the storage of the kernel is a major concern. Please note that only
 * the lower triangular part of the Gram matrix is stored, in order to exploit
 * the symmetry.
 *
 * Since the methods modifies the object's state, using the methods of this
 * class from multiple threads may result in undesired/incorrect results/behavior.
 *
 * NOTE: \f$n_x\f$ and \f$n_y\f$ are represented by \f$m\f$ and \f$n\f$,
 * respectively in the implementation.
