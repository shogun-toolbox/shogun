/**
 * @brief Provides an interface for performing the independence test.
 * Given samples \f$Z=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^m\f$ from the joint distribution
 * \f$\textbf{P}_{xy}\f$, whether the joint distribution factorize as
 * \f$\textbf{P}_{xy}=\textbf{P}_x\textbf{P}_y\f$, i.e. product of the marginals.
 * The null-hypothesis says yes, i.e. no dependence, the alternative hypothesis
 * says no.
 *
 * Abstract base class. Provides all interfaces and implements approximating
 * the null distribution via permutation, i.e. shuffling the samples from
 * one distribution repeatedly using subsets while keeping the samples from
 * the other distribution in its original order
