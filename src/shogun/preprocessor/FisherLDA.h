	/** @brief Preprocessor FisherLDA attempts to model the difference between
	 * the classes of data by performing linear discriminant analysis on input
	 * feature vectors/matrices. When the fit method in FisherLDA is called with
	 * proper feature matrix X(say N number of vectors and D feature
	 * dimensions), this creates a transformation whose outputs are the reduced
	 * T-Dimensional & class-specific distribution (where T<= number of unique
	 * classes-1). The transformation matrix is essentially a DxT matrix, the
	 * columns of which correspond to the specified number of eigenvectors which
	 * maximizes the ratio of between class matrix to within class matrix.
	 *
	 * This class provides 3 method options to compute the transformation
	 * matrix:
	 *
	 * <em>::CLASSIC_FLDA</em> : This method selects W in such a way that the
	 * ratio of the between-class scatter and the within class scatter is
	 * maximized.
	 * The between class matrix is :
	 * \f$\sum_b = \sum_{i=1}^C{\bf{(\mu_i-\mu)(\mu_i-\mu)^T}}\f$
	 * The within class matrix is :
	 * \f$\sum_w =
	 * \sum_{i=1}^C{\sum_{x_k\in}^c{\bf{(\mu_i-\mu)(\mu_i-\mu)^T}}}\f$
	 * This should be choosen when N>D
	 *
	 * <em>::CANVAR_FLDA</em> : This method performs Canonical Variates which
	 * generalises Fisher's method to projection of more than one dimension.
	 * This is equipped to handle the cases where the within class matrix are
	 * non-invertible. Can be used for both cases(D>N or D<N). See the
	 * implementation in Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning by David
	 * Barber, Section 16.3
	 *
	 * <em>::AUTO_FLDA</em> : Automagically, the appropriate method is selected
	 * based on whether D>N (chooses ::CANVAR_FLDA) or D<N(chooses
	 * ::CLASSIC_FLDA)
