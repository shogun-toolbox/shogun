/** @brief Class CBAHSIC, that extends CKernelDependenceMaximization and uses
 * HSIC [1] to compute dependence measures for feature selection using a
 * backward elimination approach as described in [1]. This class serves as a
 * convenience class that initializes the CDependenceMaximization#m_estimator
 * with an instance of CHSIC and allows only ::BACKWARD_ELIMINATION algorithm
 * to use which is set internally. Therefore, trying to use other algorithms
 * by set_algorithm() will not work. Plese see the class documentation of CHSIC
 * and [2] for more details on mathematical description of HSIC.
