/** @brief Template class CFeatureSelection, base class for all feature
 * selection preprocessors which select a subset of features (dimensions in the
 * feature matrix) to achieve a specified number of dimensions, #m_target_dim
 * from a given set of features. This class showcases all feature selection
 * algorithms via a generic interface. Supported algorithms are specified by
 * the enum #EFeatureSelectionAlgorithm which can be set via set_algorithm()
 * call. Supported wrapper algorithms are
 *
 * - shogun::BACKWARD_ELIMINATION: apply_backward_elimination() method implements
 * this algorithm. This runs inside a loop till it reaches #m_target_dim. In
 * each iteration, inside another loop that runs for all current dimensions we
 * compute measures and store the scores for each current dimension. Based on
 * those measures a number of features are removed at once.
 *
 * - shogun::FORWARD_SELECTION: apply_forward_selection() method implements this
 * algorithm. Inside a loop it adds selected features to an empty feature set
 * till it reaches #m_target_dim. In each iteration, inside another loop that
 * runs for all current dimensions we compute measures and store the scores for
 * each current dimension. Based on those measures a number of features are
 * removed from the original feature set and added to the new feature set.
 *
 * Since all these algorithm cannot be applied for all the feature selection
 * approaches, the method set_algorithm() is kept abstract which is defined
 * in the subclasses as appropriate.
 *
 * The apply() method acts as a wrapper which decides which above methods to
 * call based on the algorithm specified by #m_algorithm. This method makes
 * a deep copy of the original feature object using CSGObject::clone and then
 * performs feature selection on it. The actual memory requirement depends on
 * how copying a dimension subset is handled in CFeatures::copy_dimension_subset
 * implementation.
 *
 * For computing the measures that are used to rank the features for feature
 * selection task, it relies on an abstract method compute_measures() which
 * is defined in the subclasses.
 *
 * Due to the difference in the measure, the removal policy for features can be
 * different which is specified by the #EFeatureRemovalPolicy enum and can be
 * set by set_policy() call. The supported policies are
 *
 * - shogun::N_SMALLEST: Features corresponding to N smallest measures are removed
 * - shogun::PERCENTILE_SMALLEST: Features corresponding to smallest N% measures are
 *   removed
 * - shogun::N_LARGEST: Features corresponding to N largeest measures are removed
 * - shogun::PERCENTILE_LARGEST: Features corresponding to largest N% measures are
 *   removed
 *
 * Note that not all policies can be adapted for a specific feature seleciton
 * approaches. In general, in classes where feature selection is performed by
 * removing the features which correspond to lowest measure, the policies
 * shogun::N_SMALLEST and shogun::PERCENTILE_SMALLEST are appropriate. When features
 * corresponding to highest measures are removed (e.g. training error in a
 * cross-validation scenario), shogun::N_LARGEST and shogun::PERCENTILE_LARGEST are
 * applicable. Therefore, set_policy() is kept abstract and subclasses define
 * this to allow specific policies to be set.
 *
 * Removal of features in each iteration is handled by an abstract method
 * remove_feats() that removes a set of features at once based on the ranks
 * of the features on the measure. Internally this method also updates a subset
 * stack to keep track of the selected features. After calling apply(),
 * the indices of the original features that are selected can be obtained
 * by calling get_selected_feats() method. Please note that the selected
 * features are always kept in the original order.
 *
 * Some of the methods are for internal purpose and are not exposed to the
 * public API. For example,
 *
 * - method precompute() is provided which is intended to be overridden in the
 * subclasses to perform specific tasks that can be completed beforehand in the
 * feature selection algorithms. For example, see CKernelDependenceMaximization.
 *
 * - method adapt_params() is also overridden in the subclasses which tunes
 * the parameters based on current features that are then used to compute the
 * measure.
