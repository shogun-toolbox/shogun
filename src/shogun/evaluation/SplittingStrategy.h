/** @brief Abstract base class for all splitting types.
 * Takes a Labels instance and generates a desired number of subsets which are
 * being accessed by their indices via the method  generate_subset_indices(...).
 *
 * When being extended, the abstract method build_subsets() has to be
 * implemented.
 * build_subsets implementations HAVE TO call reset_subsets before, in order
 * to allow calling them from the outside. Also they HAVE to set the m_is_filled
 * flag to true (otherwise there will be an error when accessing the index sets)
 *
 * Implementations have to (re)fill the DynamicArray<index_t> elements in the
 * (inherited) m_subset_indices variable. Note that these elements are already
 * created by the constructor of this class - they just have to be filled. Every
 * element represents one index subset.
 *
 * Calling the method agains means that the indices are rebuilt.
