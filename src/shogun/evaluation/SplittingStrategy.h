 * being accessed by their indices via the method  generate_subset_indices(...).
 *
 * When being extended, the abstract method build_subsets() has to be
 * implemented AND to be called in the constructor of sub-classes.
 * Implementations have to fill the CDynamicArray<index_t> elements in the
 * (inherited) m_subset_indices variable. Note that these elements are already
 * created by the constructor of this class - they just have to be filled. Every
 * element represents one index subset.
