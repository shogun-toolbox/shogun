	 * The strategy builds a given number of subsets each filled with labels
	 * indices greater than a split index. The split indices are \f$ c[N/K] \f$
	 * where \f$N\f$ is number of labels,\f$K\f$ is number of subsets and
	 * \f$c = 1,2,3,...,K-1\f$. The last split index is \f$ N-h \f$.
	 *
	 * If forecasting h-step ahead, set minimum subset size to h(Default is 1).
	 *
	 * Given, \f$h = 2\f$ and \f$K = 2\f$ and \f$A = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\f$.
	 * The two splits are \f$ S1 = [5,6,7,8,9] \f$ and \f$ S2 = [8,9]\f$
