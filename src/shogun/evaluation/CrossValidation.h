/** @brief base class for cross-validation evaluation.
 * Given a learning machine, a splitting strategy, an evaluation criterium,
 * features and correspnding labels, this provides an interface for
 * cross-validation. Results may be retrieved using the evaluate method. A
 * number of repetitions may be specified for obtaining more accurate results.
 * The arithmetic mean of different runs is returned along with confidence
 * intervals, if a p-value is specified.
 * Default number of runs is one, confidence interval combutation is disabled.
 *
 * This class calculates an evaluation criterium of every fold and then
 * calculates the arithmetic mean of all folds. This is for example suitable
 * for the AUC or for Accuracy. However, for example F1-measure may not be
 * merged this way (result will be biased). To solve this, different sub-classes
 * may average results of each cross validation fold differently by overwriting
 * the evaluate_one_run method.
 *
 * See [Forman, G. and Scholz, M. (2009). Apples-to-apples in cross-validation
 * studies: Pitfalls in classifier performance measurement. Technical report,
 * HP Laboratories.] for details on this subject.
 *
 * TODO say something about locking and custom kernel
