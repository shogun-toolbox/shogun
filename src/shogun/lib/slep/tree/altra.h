/*
 * Important Notice: September 20, 2010
 *
 * In this head file, we assume that the features in the tree strucutre
 * are well ordered. That is to say, the indices of the left nodes is always less
 * than the right nodes. Ideally, this can be achieved by reordering the features.
 *
 * The advantage of this ordered features is that, we donot need to use an explicit
 * variable for recording the indices.
 *
 * To deal with the more general case when the features might not be well ordered,
 * we provide the functions in the head file "general_altra.h". Compared with the files in this head file,
 * we need an additional parameter G, which contains the indices of the nodes.

 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * altra solves the following problem
 *
 * 1/2 \|x-v\|^2 + \sum \lambda_i \|x_{G_i}\|,
 *
 * where x and v are of dimension n,
 *       \lambda_i >=0, and G_i's follow the tree structure
 *
 * It is implemented in Matlab as follows:
 *
 * x=altra(v, n, ind, nodes);
 *
 * ind is a 3 x nodes matrix.
 *       Each column corresponds to a node.
 *
 *       The first element of each column is the starting index,
 *       the second element of each column is the ending index
 *       the third element of each column corrreponds to \lambbda_i.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                       Notices:
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. The nodes in the parameter "ind" should be given in the 
 *    either
 *           the postordering of depth-first traversal
 *    or 
 *           the reverse breadth-first traversal.
 *
 * 2. When each elements of x are penalized via the same L1 
 *    (equivalent to the L2 norm) parameter, one can simplify the input
 *    by specifying 
 *           the "first" column of ind as (-1, -1, lambda)
 *
 *    In this case, we treat it as a single "super" node. Thus in the value
 *    nodes, we only count it once.
 *
 * 3. The values in "ind" are in [1,n].
 *
 * 4. The third element of each column should be positive. The program does
 *    not check the validity of the parameter. 
 *
 *    It is still valid to use the zero regularization parameter.
 *    In this case, the program does not change the values of 
 *    correponding indices.
 *
