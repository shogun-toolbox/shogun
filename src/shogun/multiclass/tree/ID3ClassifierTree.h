/** @brief class ID3ClassifierTree, implements classifier tree for discrete feature 
 * values using the ID3 algorithm. The training algorithm implemented is as follows :
 *
 * function ID3 (R: a set of non-categorical attributes,
 *		 C: the categorical attribute,
 *		 S: a training set) returns a decision tree;
 * begin
 *	If S consists of records all with the same value for 
 *	   the categorical attribute, 
 *	   return a single node with that value;
 *	If R is empty, then return a single node with as value
 *	   the most frequent of the values of the categorical attribute
 *	   that are found in records of S; [note that then there
 *	   will be errors, that is, records that will be improperly
 *	   classified];
 *	Let D be the attribute with largest Gain(D,S) 
 *	   among attributes in R;
 *	Let \f${d_j| j=1,2, .., m}\f$ be the values of attribute D;
 *	Let \f${S_j| j=1,2, .., m}\f$ be the subsets of S consisting 
 *	   respectively of records with value dj for attribute D;
 *	Return a tree with root labeled D and arcs labeled 
 *	  \f$d_1, d_2, .., d_m\f$ going respectively to the trees 
 *	ID3(R-{D}, C, \f$S_1\f$), .., ID3(R-{D}, C, \f$S_m\f$);
