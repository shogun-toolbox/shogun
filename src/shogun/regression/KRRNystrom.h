/** @brief Class KRRNystrom implements the Nyström method for kernel ridge
 * regression, using a low-rank approximation to the kernel matrix.
 *
 * The method is equivalent to ordinary kernel ridge regression, but through
 * projecting the data on a subset of the data points, the full
 * kernel matrix does not need to be computed, and the resulting system of
 * equations for the alphas is cheaper to solve.
 *
 * Instead of the original linear system, the following approximate system
 * is solved
 *
 * \f[
 * {\bf \alpha} = (\tau K_{m,m} + K_{m,n}K_{n,m})^+K_{m,n} {\bf y}
 * ]
 *
 * where \f$K_{n,m}\f$ is a submatrix containing all n rows and the m columns
 * corresponding to the m chosen training examples, \f$K_{m,n}\f$ is its
 * transpose and \f$K_{m,m} is the submatrix with the m rows and columns
 * corresponding to the training examples chosen. \f$+\f$ indicates the
 * Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. The complexity is \f$O(m^2n)\f$.
 *
 * Several ways to subsample columns/rows have been proposed. Here they are
 * subsampled uniformly. To implement another sampling method one has to
 * override the method 'subsample_indices'.
