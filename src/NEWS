	* This release also contains several enhancements, cleanups and bugfixes:

		  By Heiko Strathmann.

		  of streamed features that are stored in memory and returned as a
		  CFeatures* object of corresponding type. See
		  CStreamingFeatures::get_streamed_features().
		- New concept of artificial data generator classes: Based on streaming
		  features. First implemented instances are CMeanShiftDataGenerator and
		  CGaussianBlobsDataGenerator.

          custom kernel matrices with subsets attached to them.
		- Fix for parameter dictionary creationg causing dereferencing null pointers
		  with gaussian processes parameter selection.
		- Fixed a bug in exact GP regression that caused wrong results.
		- Fixed a bug in exact GP regression that produced memory errors/crashes.
		- Fix for a bug with static interfaces causing all outputs to be
		  -1/+1 instead of real scores (reported by Kamikawa Masahisa).

	* This release contains several cleanups and bugfixes:
		- Implement KernelNormalizer class with a couple of normalization
		functions that can now be attached to almost any kernel via
		set_normalizer() in the modular and set_kernel_normalization in the
		static interfaces. This fixes a long standing bug in the
		WeightedDegreePositionStringKernel normalization WARNING will break
		compatibility to all previously trained WD-shift kernel models, use
		FIRSTELEMENT / CFirstElementKernelNormalizer for an *approximation* to
		the previous buggy behaviour. Also breaks WordMatchKernel as for this
		kernel normalization is now enabled by default.
		- The custom kernel no longer requires lhs/rhs features (it will create
				its own dummy features)
		- Linear kernels don't use kernel cache (only slows down things)
		- Integrate the Oligo string-kernel (from Meinecke et.al 2004)
		- Remove use_precompute hack from SVMLight.
		- Add precompute_kernels function to turn kernels appended to a
		combined kernel into CustomKernels (i.e. precomputed ones).
		- Add distances BrayCurtis, ChiSquare, Cosine and Tanimoto.
	* Bugfixes:
		- Support Intel MKL on 32bit archs.
		- Fix compilation when atlas/lapack is not available.

		use it.
		- Add examples for cmdline interface.

		- Support for cplex 11.
		- Port MKL examples to R.
		- Merge structure learning branch.
	* Bugfixes:

		and throw exceptions for messages with priority ERROR or higher.
		- Compile fix when lapack is not available.
		- Fix when only lapack and blas (but not atlas) are available.
		- Fix bug in batch/linadd occurring for WD kernel of order 1.
		- Check that strings have same length on initing WD kernels.
		- Remove signal handler on Ctrl+C to fix Ctrl+C pressed twice bug.
		- All derived classes now call their parent class on construction.
		- Fix a crasher occuring with SVRLight on multiple threads.

2008-05-15  Soeren Sonnenburg <debian@nn7.de>

	* SHOGUN Release version 0.6.2
		- Experimental support for r-modular thanks to the swig team!
		- All python-modular examples describing the use of kernels,
		classifier, distributions, features, distances, regression and
		preprocessors have been ported to r-modular (requires swig from svn).
		- The 'send_command' legacy is no longer necessary, numbers can be used
		as such and don't have to be given as strings. All examples for
		r,python,octave,matlab have been converted to the new syntax.
		- Resurrected the command line interface. Basic functionionality,
		like training a classifier on strings/real valued (sparse) features
		was restored. Readline completion was added.
		- Documentation updates.
	* Bugfixes:
		- The weighted spectrum kernel is now working again.
		- Fix the testsuite to reliably check methods that use random().
		- Off-by-one bug fix in FixedDegreeStringKernel.
		- Fix reading strings from file, when strings don't have the same length.
		- Fix massive slowdown in modular interfaces for WD based kernels (it
		is 5-30 times faster now).

		interface.
