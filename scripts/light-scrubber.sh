# Scrub stuff that depends or links against SVM^light, which we can't ship in
# tarballs used for several linux-distros.  Thanks to Dr. Sören Sonnenburg
# (sonney2k), the upstream author, for this.  The scriptlets have been
# slightly modified by me to preserve the original timestamps.
#
# TODO: Some next release or git-snapshot ships GPL'ed replacement of SVMlight
# called SVMbright.  The scriptlet isn't needed anymore when this will be.
