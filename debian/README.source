This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

To get the fully patched source after unpacking the source package, cd to
the root level of the source package and run:

    quilt push -a

The last patch listed in debian/patches/series will become the current
patch.

To add a new set of changes, first run quilt push -a, and then run:

    quilt new <patch>

where <patch> is a descriptive name for the patch, used as the filename in
debian/patches.  Then, for every file that will be modified by this patch,
run:

    quilt add <file>

before editing those files.  You must tell quilt with quilt add what files
will be part of the patch before making changes or quilt will not work
properly.  After editing the files, run:

    quilt refresh

to save the results as a patch.

Alternately, if you already have an external patch and you just want to
add it to the build system, run quilt push -a and then:

    quilt import -P <patch> /path/to/patch
    quilt push -a

(add -p 0 to quilt import if needed). <patch> as above is the filename to
use in debian/patches.  The last quilt push -a will apply the patch to
make sure it works properly.

To remove an existing patch from the list of patches that will be applied,
run:

    quilt delete <patch>

You may need to run quilt pop -a to unapply patches first before running
this command.
