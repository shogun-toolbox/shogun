## Interfaces
-------------

Shogun is implemented in C++ and offers automatically generated, unified interfaces to Python, Octave, Java / Scala, Ruby, C#, R, Lua. We are currently working on adding more languages including JavaScript, D, and Matlab.

|    Interface     |     Status                                                |
|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|python            | *mature* (no known problems)                              |
|octave            | *mature* (no known problems)                              |
|java/scala        | *stable* (no known problems)                              |
|ruby              | *stable* (no known problems)                              |
|csharp            | *stable* (no known problems)                              |
|r                 | *beta*   (most examples work, static calls unavailable)   |
|lua               | *alpha*  (many examples work, string typemaps are unstable, overloaded methods unavailable)                   |
|perl              | *pre-alpha* (work in progress quality)                    |
|js                | *pre-alpha* (work in progress quality)                    |

See [our website](http://shogun.ml/examples) for examples in all languages.

## Platforms
