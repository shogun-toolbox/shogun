## Interfaces
-------------

Shogun is implemented in C++ and interfaces to Python, octave, java, ruby, C#, R, Lua, Perl. JavaScript and Matlab are planned to be (re-)introduced soon.

|    Interface     |     Status                                                |
|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|python            | *mature* (no known problems)                              |
|octave            | *mature* (no known problems)                              |
|java              | *stable* (no known problems)                              |
|ruby              | *stable* (no known problems)                              |
|csharp            | *stable* (no known problems)                              |
|r                 | *beta*   (most examples work, static calls unavailable)   |
|lua               | *alpha*  (many examples work, string typemaps are unstable,
                             overloaded methods unavailable)                   |
|perl              | *pre-alpha* (work in progress quality)                    |
|js                | *pre-alpha* (work in progress quality)                    |
