		WeightedDegreePositionStringKernel normalization WARNING will break
		compatibility to all previously trained WD-shift kernel models, use
		FIRSTELEMENT / CFirstElementKernelNormalizer for an *approximation* to
		the previous buggy behaviour. Also breaks WordMatchKernel as for this
		kernel normalization is now enabled by default.
		- The custom kernel no longer requires lhs/rhs features (it will create
				its own dummy features)
		- Linear kernels don't use kernel cache (only slows down things)
