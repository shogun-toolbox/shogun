This directory contains mostly legacy regression test scripts that will soon no
longer be used (bummer, all this work for nothing!).

The new way to check for regressions is via the following two
scripts:

  generator.pl  - to generate regression tests and
  tester.pl - to check for regressions

So tester.pl is sufficient.
