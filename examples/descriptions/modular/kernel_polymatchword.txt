The PolyMatchWordString kernel is defined on strings of equal length.
The kernel sums over the matches of two stings of the same length and
takes the sum to the power of 'degree'. The strings in this example
consist of the characters 'ACGT' corresponding to the DNA-alphabet. Each
column of the matrices of type char corresponds to one training/test example.
