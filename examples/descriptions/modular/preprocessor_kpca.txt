This example shows the implementation of Kernel PCA algorithim on a unclustered dataset.The output dataset
will be clustered.
The code sets the target dimension of the output data i.e. after kernel pca to 2.
For example,if the input dataset is circular dataset with 2 labels(say positive and negative labels),then the output dataset will be in the form of 2 clusters, each cluster representing one of the labels.
The kernel used is a GAUSSIAN kernel.
