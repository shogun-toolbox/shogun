This is an example for the initialization of the PolyMatchString kernel on string data.
The PolyMatchString kernel sums over the matches of two stings of the same length and
takes the sum to the power of 'degree'. The strings consist of the characters 'ACGT' corresponding
to the DNA-alphabet. Each column of the matrices of type char corresponds to
one training/test example.
