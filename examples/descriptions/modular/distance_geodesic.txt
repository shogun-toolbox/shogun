An approach as applied below, which shows the processing of input data
from a file becomes a crucial factor for writing your own sample applications.
This approach is just one example of what can be done using the distance
functions provided by shogun.

First, you need to determine what type your data will be, because this
will determine the distance function you can use.

This example loads two stored matrices of real values from different
files and initializes the matrices to 'RealFeatures'.
Each column of the matrices corresponds to one data point.

The distance initialized by two data sets (the same data set as shown in the
first call) controls the processing of the given data points, where a
pairwise distance (shortest path on a sphere) matrix is computed
by 'get_distance_matrix'.

The resulting distance matrix can be reaccessed by 'get_distance_matrix'.

The method call 'init'* binds the given data sets, where a pairwise distance
(shortest path on a sphere) matrix between these two data sets is
computed by 'get_distance_matrix'.

The resulting distance matrix can be reaccessed by 'get_distance_matrix'.

*Note that the previous computed distance matrix can no longer be
reaccessed by 'get_distance_matrix'.

Obviously, using the Geodesic distance is not limited to this showcase
example.
