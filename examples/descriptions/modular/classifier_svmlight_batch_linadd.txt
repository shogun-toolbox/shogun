In this example a two-class support vector machine classifier is trained on a
DNA splice-site detection data set and the trained classifier is used to predict
labels on test set. As training algorithm SVM^light is used with SVM
regularization parameter C=1 and the Weighted Degree kernel of the degree 20 and
a precision parameter epsilon=1e-5. The LINADD trick is used to speed up
training.
