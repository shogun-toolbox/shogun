This example demonstrates how to use compressed strings with shogun.
We currently support reading and writing compressed files using
LZO, GZIP, BZIP2 and LZMA. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to extract
compressed streams on-the-fly in order to fit data sets into
memory that would be too large, otherwise.
