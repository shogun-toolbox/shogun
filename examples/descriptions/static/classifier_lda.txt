In this example a linear two-class classifier is trained based on the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) from a toy 2-dimensional examples. The trained
LDA classifier is used to predict test examples. Note that the LDA classifier
is optimal under the assumption that both classes are Gaussian distributed with equal
co-variance. For more details on the LDA see e.g.
