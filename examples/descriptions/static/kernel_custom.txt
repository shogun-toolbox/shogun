A user defined custom kernel is assigned in this example, for which only the upper triangle may be given (DIAG) or
the FULL matrix (FULL), or the full matrix which is then internally stored as a upper
triangle (FULL2DIAG). Labels for the examples are given, a svm is trained and the svm is used to classify the examples.
