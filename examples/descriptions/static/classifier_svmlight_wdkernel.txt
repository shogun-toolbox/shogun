In this example a two-class support vector machine classifier is trained on a
DNA splice-site detection data set and the trained classifier is used to
predict labels on test set. As training algorithm SVM^light is used with SVM
regularization parameter C=1 and the Weighted Degree kernel and the bias term in
the classification rule switched off.

 spliced exons in C. elegans. Bioinformatics, 21:369-377, June 2005.
