This example initializes the locality improved string kernel. The locality improved string
kernel is defined on sequences of the same length and inspects letters matching at
corresponding positions in both sequences. The kernel sums over all matches in windows of
length l and takes this sum to the power of 'inner_degree'. The sum over all these
terms along the sequence is taken to the power of 'outer_degree'.
