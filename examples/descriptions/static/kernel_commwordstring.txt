This is an example for the initialization of the CommWordString-kernel (aka
Spectrum or n-gram kernel; its name is derived from the unix command comm). This kernel
sums over k-mere matches (k='order'). For efficient computing a preprocessor is used
that extracts and sorts all k-mers. If 'use_sign' is set to one each k-mere is counted
only once.
