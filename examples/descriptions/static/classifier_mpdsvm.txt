In this example a two-class support vector machine classifier is trained on a
toy data set and the trained classifier is used to predict labels of test
examples. As training algorithm the Minimal Primal Dual SVM is used with SVM
regularization parameter C=1.2 and a Gaussian kernel of width 2.1 and 10MB of
kernel cache and the precision parameter epsilon=1e-5.
